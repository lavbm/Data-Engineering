PREDNISOLONE,30,801,Swelling face,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING . Two drops topically in the affected eye(s) four times daily. In cases of bacterial infections, concomitant use of anti-infective agents is mandatory. Care should be taken not to discontinue therapy prematurely. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be reevaluated (see PRECAUTIONS ). The dosing of prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension may be reduced, but care should be taken not to discontinue therapy prematurely. In chronic conditions, withdrawal of treatment should be carried out by gradually decreasing the frequency of applications.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe, such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitides, when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation; corneal injury from chemical, radiation, or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies.","WARNINGS: FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Prolonged use may also suppress the host immune response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. Various ocular diseases and long-term use of topical corticosteroids have been known to cause corneal and scleral thinning. Use of topical corticosteroids in the presence of thin corneal or scleral tissue may lead to perforation. Acute purulent infections of the eye may be masked or activity enhanced by the presence of corticosteroid medication. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. IOP should be checked frequently. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution; frequent slit lamp microscopy is recommended. Corticosteroids are not effective in mustard gas keratitis and Sjogren's keratoconjunctivitis.",Sandoz Inc,PREDNISOLONE ACETATE

CYCLOSPORINE,43,801,Pneumonia,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cyclosporine capsules (modified) has increased bioavailability in comparison to Sandimmune ® . Cyclosporine capsules (modified) and Sandimmune ® are not bioequivalent and cannot be used interchangeably without physician supervision. The daily dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) should always be given in two divided doses (BID). It is recommended that cyclosporine capsules (modified) be administered on a consistent schedule with regard to time of day and relation to meals. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice affect metabolism, increasing blood concentration of cyclosporine, thus should be avoided. Specific Populations Renal Impairment in Kidney, Liver, and Heart Transplantation Cyclosporine undergoes minimal renal elimination and its pharmacokinetics do not appear to be significantly altered in patients with end-stage renal disease who receive routine hemodialysis treatments (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). However, due to its nephrotoxic potential (see WARNINGS ), careful monitoring of renal function is recommended; cyclosporine dosage should be reduced if indicated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Renal Impairment in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriasis Patients with impaired renal function should not receive cyclosporine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment The clearance of cyclosporine may be significantly reduced in severe liver disease patients ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment to maintain blood concentrations within the recommended target range (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Newly Transplanted Patients The initial oral dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) can be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation or be given postoperatively. The initial dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) varies depending on the transplanted organ and the other immunosuppressive agents included in the immunosuppressive protocol. In newly transplanted patients, the initial oral dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) is the same as the initial oral dose of Sandimmune ®. Suggested initial doses are available from the results of a 1994 survey of the use of Sandimmune ® in US transplant centers. The mean ± SD initial doses were 9 ± 3 mg/kg/day for renal transplant patients (75 centers), 8 ± 4 mg/kg/day for liver transplant patients (30 centers), and 7 ± 3 mg/kg/day for heart transplant patients (24 centers). Total daily doses were divided into two equal daily doses. The cyclosporine capsules (modified) dose is subsequently adjusted to achieve a pre-defined cyclosporine blood concentration (see Blood Concentration Monitoring in Transplant Patients , below). If cyclosporine trough blood concentrations are used, the target range is the same for cyclosporine capsules (modified) as for Sandimmune ® . Using the same trough concentration target range for cyclosporine capsules (modified) as for Sandimmune ® results in greater cyclosporine exposure when cyclosporine capsules (modified) is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption ). Dosing should be titrated based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability. Lower cyclosporine capsules (modified) doses may be sufficient as maintenance therapy. Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended initially. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A representative dosage schedule based on the patient's weight started with 2.0 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on status of patient and function of graft. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation. Conversion from Sandimmune® to cyclosporine capsules (modified) in Transplant Patients In transplanted patients who are considered for conversion to cyclosporine capsules (modified) from Sandimmune ® , cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be started with the same daily dose as was previously used with Sandimmune ® (1:1 dose conversion). The cyclosporine capsules (modified) dose should subsequently be adjusted to attain the pre-conversion cyclosporine blood trough concentration. Using the same trough concentration target range for cyclosporine capsules (modified) as for Sandimmune ® results in greater cyclosporine exposure when cyclosporine capsules (modified) is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption ). Patients with suspected poor absorption of Sandimmune ® require different dosing strategies (see Transplant Patients with Poor absorption of Sandimmune ® , below). In some patients, the increase in blood trough concentration is more pronounced and may be of clinical significance. Until the blood trough concentration attains the pre-conversion value, it is strongly recommended that the cyclosporine blood trough concentration be monitored every 4 to 7 days after conversion to cyclosporine capsules, (modified). In addition, clinical safety parameters such as serum creatinine and blood pressure should be monitored every two weeks during the first two months after conversion. If the blood trough concentrations are outside the desired range and/or if the clinical safety parameters worsen, the dosage of cyclosporine capsules (modified) must be adjusted accordingly. Transplant Patients with Poor Absorption of Sandimmune Patients with lower than expected cyclosporine blood trough concentrations in relation to the oral dose of Sandimmune may have poor or inconsistent absorption of cyclosporine from Sandimmune. After conversion to cyclosporine capsules, (modified), patients tend to have higher cyclosporine concentrations. Due to the increase in bioavailability of cyclosporine following conversion to cyclosporine capsules, (modified), the cyclosporine blood trough concentration may exceed the target range. Particular caution should be exercised when converting patients to cyclosporine capsules (modified) at doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day. The dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be titrated individually based on cyclosporine trough concentrations, tolerability, and clinical response. In this population the cyclosporine blood trough concentration should be measured more frequently, at least twice a week (daily, if initial dose exceeds 10 mg/kg/day) until the concentration stabilizes within the desired range. Rheumatoid Arthritis The initial dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) is 2.5 mg/kg/day, taken twice daily as a divided (BID) oral dose. Salicylates, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids may be continued (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Onset of action generally occurs between 4 and 8 weeks. If insufficient clinical benefit is seen and tolerability is good (including serum creatinine less than 30% above baseline), the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg/day after 8 weeks and again after 12 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg/kg/day. If no benefit is seen by 16 weeks of therapy, cyclosporine capsules (modified) therapy should be discontinued. Dose decreases by 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, e.g., hypertension elevations in serum creatinine (30% above patient's pretreatment level) or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be discontinued. The same initial dose and dosage range should be used if cyclosporine capsules (modified) is combined with the recommended dose of methotrexate. Most patients can be treated with cyclosporine capsules (modified) doses of 3 mg/kg/day or below when combined with methotrexate doses of up to 15 mg/week (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials ). There is limited long-term treatment data. Recurrence of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is generally apparent within 4 weeks after stopping cyclosporine. Psoriasis The initial dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be 2.5 mg/kg/day. Cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be taken twice daily, as a divided (1.25 mg/kg BID) oral dose. Patients should be kept at that dose for at least 4 weeks, barring adverse events. If significant clinical improvement has not occurred in patients by that time, the patient's dosage should be increased at 2-week intervals. Based on patient response, dose increases of approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day should be made to a maximum of 4.0 mg/kg/day. Dose decreases by 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, e.g., hypertension, elevations in serum creatinine (≥ 25% above the patient's pretreatment level), or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities, or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be discontinued (see Special Monitoring of Psoriasis Patients ) Patients generally show some improvement in the clinical manifestations of psoriasis in 2 weeks. Satisfactory control and stabilization of the disease may take 12 to 16 weeks to achieve. Results of a dose-titration clinical trial with cyclosporine capsules (modified) indicate that an improvement of psoriasis by 75% or more (based on PASI) was achieved in 51% of the patients after 8 weeks and in 79% of the patients after 16 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued if satisfactory response cannot be achieved after 6 weeks at 4 mg/kg/day or the patient's maximum tolerated dose. Once a patient is adequately controlled and appears stable the dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be lowered, and the patient treated with the lowest dose that maintains an adequate response (this should not necessarily be total clearing of the patient). In clinical trials, cyclosporine doses at the lower end of the recommended dosage range were effective in maintaining a satisfactory response in 60% of the patients. Doses below 2.5 mg/kg/day may also be equally effective. Upon stopping treatment with cyclosporine, relapse will occur in approximately 6 weeks (50% of the patients) to 16 weeks (75% of the patients). In the majority of patients rebound does not occur after cessation of treatment with cyclosporine. Thirteen cases of transformation of chronic plaque psoriasis to more severe forms of psoriasis have been reported. There were 9 cases of pustular and 4 cases of erythrodermic psoriasis. Long term experience with cyclosporine capsules (modified) in psoriasis patients is limited and continuous treatment for extended periods greater than one year is not recommended. Alternation with other forms of treatment should be considered in the long term management of patients with this life long disease. Blood Concentration Monitoring in Transplant Patients Transplant centers have found blood concentration monitoring of cyclosporine to be an essential component of patient management. Of importance to blood concentration analysis are the type of assay used, the transplanted organ, and other immunosuppressant agents being administered. While no fixed relationship has been established, blood concentration monitoring may assist in the clinical evaluation of rejection and toxicity, dose adjustments, and the assessment of compliance. Various assays have been used to measure blood concentrations of cyclosporine. Older studies using a nonspecific assay often cited concentrations that were roughly twice those of the specific assays. Therefore, comparison between concentrations in the published literature and an individual patient concentration using current assays must be made with detailed knowledge of the assay methods employed. Current assay results are also not interchangeable and their use should be guided by their approved labeling. A discussion of the different assay methods is contained in Annals of Clinical Biochemistry 1994; 31:420 to 446. While several assays and assay matrices are available, there is a consensus that parent-compound-specific assays correlate best with clinical events. Of these, HPLC is the standard reference, but the monoclonal antibody RIAs and the monoclonal antibody FPIA offer sensitivity, reproducibility, and convenience. Most clinicians base their monitoring on trough cyclosporine concentrations. Applied Pharmacokinetics, Principles of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (1992) contains a broad discussion of cyclosporine pharmacokinetics and drug monitoring techniques. Blood concentration monitoring is not a replacement for renal function monitoring or tissue biopsies.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Kidney, Liver, and Heart Transplantation Cyclosporine capsules (modified) is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart allogeneic transplants. Cyclosporine capsules (modified) has been used in combination with azathioprine and corticosteroids. Rheumatoid Arthritis Cyclosporine capsules (modified) is indicated for the treatment of patients with severe active, rheumatoid arthritis where the disease has not adequately responded to methotrexate. Cyclosporine capsules (modified) can be used in combination with methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients who do not respond adequately to methotrexate alone. Psoriasis Cyclosporine capsules (modified) is indicated for the treatment of adult, nonimmunocompromised patients with severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling), recalcitrant, plaque psoriasis who have failed to respond to at least one systemic therapy (e.g., PUVA, retinoids, or methotrexate) or in patients for whom other systemic therapies are contraindicated, or cannot be tolerated. While rebound rarely occurs, most patients will experience relapse with cyclosporine capsules (modified) as with other therapies upon cessation of treatment.","OVERDOSAGE There is a minimal experience with cyclosporine overdosage. Forced emesis and gastric lavage can be of value up to 2 hours after administration of cyclosporine capsules, (modified). Transient hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur which should resolve following drug withdrawal. Oral doses of cyclosporine up to 10 g (about 150 mg/kg) have been tolerated with relatively minor clinical consequences, such as vomiting, drowsiness, headache, tachycardia and, in a few patients, moderately severe, reversible impairment of renal function. However, serious symptoms of intoxication have been reported following accidental parenteral overdosage with cyclosporine in premature neonates. General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be followed in all cases of overdosage. Cyclosporine is not dialyzable to any great extent, nor is it cleared well by charcoal hemoperfusion. The oral dosage at which half of experimental animals are estimated to die is 31 times, 39 times, and > 54 times the human maintenance dose for transplant patients (6mg/kg; corrections based on body surface area) in mice, rats, and rabbits.",Heritage Pharmaceuticals Inc. d/b/a Avet Pharmaceuticals Inc.,CYCLOSPORINE
CYCLOSPORINE,43,801,Pneumonia,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Cyclosporine capsules (modified) has increased bioavailability in comparison to Sandimmune ® . Cyclosporine capsules (modified) and Sandimmune ® are not bioequivalent and cannot be used interchangeably without physician supervision. The daily dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) should always be given in two divided doses (BID). It is recommended that cyclosporine capsules (modified) be administered on a consistent schedule with regard to time of day and relation to meals. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice affect metabolism, increasing blood concentration of cyclosporine, thus should be avoided. Specific Populations Renal Impairment in Kidney, Liver, and Heart Transplantation Cyclosporine undergoes minimal renal elimination and its pharmacokinetics do not appear to be significantly altered in patients with end-stage renal disease who receive routine hemodialysis treatments (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). However, due to its nephrotoxic potential (see WARNINGS ), careful monitoring of renal function is recommended; cyclosporine dosage should be reduced if indicated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Renal Impairment in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriasis Patients with impaired renal function should not receive cyclosporine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Hepatic Impairment The clearance of cyclosporine may be significantly reduced in severe liver disease patients ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment to maintain blood concentrations within the recommended target range (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Newly Transplanted Patients The initial oral dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) can be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation or be given postoperatively. The initial dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) varies depending on the transplanted organ and the other immunosuppressive agents included in the immunosuppressive protocol. In newly transplanted patients, the initial oral dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) is the same as the initial oral dose of Sandimmune ®. Suggested initial doses are available from the results of a 1994 survey of the use of Sandimmune ® in US transplant centers. The mean ± SD initial doses were 9 ± 3 mg/kg/day for renal transplant patients (75 centers), 8 ± 4 mg/kg/day for liver transplant patients (30 centers), and 7 ± 3 mg/kg/day for heart transplant patients (24 centers). Total daily doses were divided into two equal daily doses. The cyclosporine capsules (modified) dose is subsequently adjusted to achieve a pre-defined cyclosporine blood concentration (see Blood Concentration Monitoring in Transplant Patients , below). If cyclosporine trough blood concentrations are used, the target range is the same for cyclosporine capsules (modified) as for Sandimmune ® . Using the same trough concentration target range for cyclosporine capsules (modified) as for Sandimmune ® results in greater cyclosporine exposure when cyclosporine capsules (modified) is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption ). Dosing should be titrated based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability. Lower cyclosporine capsules (modified) doses may be sufficient as maintenance therapy. Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended initially. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A representative dosage schedule based on the patient's weight started with 2.0 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on status of patient and function of graft. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation. Conversion from Sandimmune® to cyclosporine capsules (modified) in Transplant Patients In transplanted patients who are considered for conversion to cyclosporine capsules (modified) from Sandimmune ® , cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be started with the same daily dose as was previously used with Sandimmune ® (1:1 dose conversion). The cyclosporine capsules (modified) dose should subsequently be adjusted to attain the pre-conversion cyclosporine blood trough concentration. Using the same trough concentration target range for cyclosporine capsules (modified) as for Sandimmune ® results in greater cyclosporine exposure when cyclosporine capsules (modified) is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption ). Patients with suspected poor absorption of Sandimmune ® require different dosing strategies (see Transplant Patients with Poor absorption of Sandimmune ® , below). In some patients, the increase in blood trough concentration is more pronounced and may be of clinical significance. Until the blood trough concentration attains the pre-conversion value, it is strongly recommended that the cyclosporine blood trough concentration be monitored every 4 to 7 days after conversion to cyclosporine capsules, (modified). In addition, clinical safety parameters such as serum creatinine and blood pressure should be monitored every two weeks during the first two months after conversion. If the blood trough concentrations are outside the desired range and/or if the clinical safety parameters worsen, the dosage of cyclosporine capsules (modified) must be adjusted accordingly. Transplant Patients with Poor Absorption of Sandimmune Patients with lower than expected cyclosporine blood trough concentrations in relation to the oral dose of Sandimmune may have poor or inconsistent absorption of cyclosporine from Sandimmune. After conversion to cyclosporine capsules, (modified), patients tend to have higher cyclosporine concentrations. Due to the increase in bioavailability of cyclosporine following conversion to cyclosporine capsules, (modified), the cyclosporine blood trough concentration may exceed the target range. Particular caution should be exercised when converting patients to cyclosporine capsules (modified) at doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day. The dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be titrated individually based on cyclosporine trough concentrations, tolerability, and clinical response. In this population the cyclosporine blood trough concentration should be measured more frequently, at least twice a week (daily, if initial dose exceeds 10 mg/kg/day) until the concentration stabilizes within the desired range. Rheumatoid Arthritis The initial dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) is 2.5 mg/kg/day, taken twice daily as a divided (BID) oral dose. Salicylates, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids may be continued (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Onset of action generally occurs between 4 and 8 weeks. If insufficient clinical benefit is seen and tolerability is good (including serum creatinine less than 30% above baseline), the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg/day after 8 weeks and again after 12 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg/kg/day. If no benefit is seen by 16 weeks of therapy, cyclosporine capsules (modified) therapy should be discontinued. Dose decreases by 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, e.g., hypertension elevations in serum creatinine (30% above patient's pretreatment level) or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be discontinued. The same initial dose and dosage range should be used if cyclosporine capsules (modified) is combined with the recommended dose of methotrexate. Most patients can be treated with cyclosporine capsules (modified) doses of 3 mg/kg/day or below when combined with methotrexate doses of up to 15 mg/week (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials ). There is limited long-term treatment data. Recurrence of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is generally apparent within 4 weeks after stopping cyclosporine. Psoriasis The initial dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be 2.5 mg/kg/day. Cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be taken twice daily, as a divided (1.25 mg/kg BID) oral dose. Patients should be kept at that dose for at least 4 weeks, barring adverse events. If significant clinical improvement has not occurred in patients by that time, the patient's dosage should be increased at 2-week intervals. Based on patient response, dose increases of approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day should be made to a maximum of 4.0 mg/kg/day. Dose decreases by 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, e.g., hypertension, elevations in serum creatinine (≥ 25% above the patient's pretreatment level), or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities, or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be discontinued (see Special Monitoring of Psoriasis Patients ) Patients generally show some improvement in the clinical manifestations of psoriasis in 2 weeks. Satisfactory control and stabilization of the disease may take 12 to 16 weeks to achieve. Results of a dose-titration clinical trial with cyclosporine capsules (modified) indicate that an improvement of psoriasis by 75% or more (based on PASI) was achieved in 51% of the patients after 8 weeks and in 79% of the patients after 16 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued if satisfactory response cannot be achieved after 6 weeks at 4 mg/kg/day or the patient's maximum tolerated dose. Once a patient is adequately controlled and appears stable the dose of cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be lowered, and the patient treated with the lowest dose that maintains an adequate response (this should not necessarily be total clearing of the patient). In clinical trials, cyclosporine doses at the lower end of the recommended dosage range were effective in maintaining a satisfactory response in 60% of the patients. Doses below 2.5 mg/kg/day may also be equally effective. Upon stopping treatment with cyclosporine, relapse will occur in approximately 6 weeks (50% of the patients) to 16 weeks (75% of the patients).

( 2.5 ) See full prescribing information (FPI) for: adjustments for renal impairment and neutropenia ( 2.5 ), preparation of oral suspension and IV solution. ( 2.6 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions CELLCEPT should not be used without the supervision of a physician with experience in immunosuppressive therapy. CELLCEPT Capsules, Tablets and Oral Suspension CELLCEPT oral dosage forms (capsules, tablets or oral suspension) should not be used interchangeably with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets without supervision of a physician with experience in immunosuppressive therapy because the rates of absorption following the administration of CELLCEPT oral dosage forms and mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not equivalent. CELLCEPT tablets should not be crushed and CELLCEPT capsules should not be opened or crushed. Patients should avoid inhalation or contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the powder contained in CELLCEPT capsules and oral suspension. If such contact occurs, they must wash the area of contact thoroughly with soap and water. In case of ocular contact, rinse eyes with plain water. The initial oral dose of CELLCEPT should be given as soon as possible following kidney, heart or liver transplant. It is recommended that CELLCEPT be administered on an empty stomach. In stable transplant patients, however, CELLCEPT may be administered with food if necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Once reconstituted, CELLCEPT Oral Suspension must not be mixed with any liquids prior to dose administration. If needed, CELLCEPT Oral Suspension can be administered via a nasogastric tube with a minimum size of 8 French (minimum 1.7 mm interior diameter). Patients should be instructed to take a missed dose as soon as they remember, except if it is closer than 2 hours to the next scheduled dose; in this case, they should continue to take CELLCEPT at the usual times. CELLCEPT Intravenous CELLCEPT Intravenous is recommended for patients unable to take oral CELLCEPT. CELLCEPT Intravenous should be administered within 24 hours following transplant. CELLCEPT Intravenous can be administered for up to 14 days; however, patients should be switched to oral CELLCEPT as soon as they can tolerate oral medication. CELLCEPT Intravenous must be reconstituted before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . CELLCEPT Intravenous is incompatible with other intravenous infusion solutions and should not be mixed or administered concurrently via the same infusion catheter with other intravenous drugs or infusion admixtures. CELLCEPT Intravenous must not be administered as a bolus. Following reconstitution, CELLCEPT Intravenous must be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a period of no less than 2 hours by either peripheral or central vein, as rapid infusion increases the risk of local adverse reactions such as phlebitis and thrombosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Kidney Transplant Patients Adults The recommended dosage for adult kidney transplant patients is 1 g orally or intravenously infused over no less than 2 hours, twice daily (total daily dose of 2 g). Pediatrics (3 months and older) Pediatric dosing is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dosage of CELLCEPT oral suspension for pediatric kidney transplant patients 3 months and older is 600 mg/m 2 , administered twice daily (maximum total daily dose of 2 g or 10 mL of the oral suspension). Pediatric patients with BSA ≥ 1.25 m 2 may be dosed with capsules or tablets as follows: Table 1 Pediatric Kidney Transplant: Dosage Using Capsules or Tablets Body Surface Area Dosage 1.25 m 2 to <1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsule 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g total daily dose) ≥ 1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsules or tablets 1 g twice daily (2 g total daily dose) 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Heart Transplant Patients Adults The recommended dosage of CELLCEPT for adult heart transplant patients is 1.5 g orally or intravenously infused over no less than 2 hours administered twice daily (total daily dose of 3 g). Pediatrics (3 months and older) The recommended starting dosage of CELLCEPT oral suspension for pediatric heart transplant patients 3 months and older is 600 mg/m 2 , administered twice daily. If well tolerated, the dose can be increased to a maintenance dosage of 900 mg/m 2 twice daily (maximum total daily dose of 3 g or 15 mL of the oral suspension). The dose may be individualized based on clinical assessment. Pediatric patients with BSA ≥1.25 m 2 may be started on therapy with capsules or tablets as follows: Table 2 Pediatric Heart Transplant: Pediatric Starting Dosage Using Capsules or Tablets Body Surface Area Starting Dosage Maximum maintenance dose: 3 g total daily. 1.25 m 2 to <1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsule 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g total daily dose) ≥ 1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsules or tablets 1 g twice daily (2 g total daily dose) 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Liver Transplant Patients Adults The recommended dosage of CELLCEPT for adult liver transplant patients is 1.5 g administered orally twice daily (total daily dose of 3 g) or 1 g infused intravenously over no less than 2 hours, twice daily (total daily dose of 2 g). Pediatrics (3 months and older) The recommended starting dosage of CELLCEPT oral suspension for pediatric liver transplant patients 3 months of age and older is 600 mg/m 2 , administered twice daily.

In kidney transplant patients with severe chronic impairment of the graft (GFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), do not administer doses of CELLCEPT greater than 1 g twice a day. These patients should be carefully monitored [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Neutropenia If neutropenia develops (ANC <1.3 × 10 3 /µL), dosing with CELLCEPT should be interrupted or reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 2.6 Preparation Instructions of Oral Suspension and Intravenous for Pharmacists General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has demonstrated teratogenic effects in humans. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1) ]. Care should be taken to avoid inhalation or direct contact with skin or mucous membranes of the dry powder or the constituted suspension because MMF has demonstrated teratogenic effects in humans . Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the bottle/cap and the table surface after reconstitution. If such contact occurs, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes with water. Alert patients that they and others should also avoid inhalation or contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the oral suspension. Advise them to wash the area thoroughly with soap and water if such contact occurs; if ocular contact occurs, rinse eyes with plain water. CELLCEPT Oral Suspension CELLCEPT Oral Suspension must be reconstituted by the pharmacist prior to dispensing to the patient. CELLCEPT Oral Suspension should not be mixed with any other medication. After reconstitution, the oral suspension contains 200 mg/mL MMF. Before proceeding with the reconstitution steps read the general preparation instructions above [see General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations ]. The following are the steps for reconstitution: Tap the closed bottle several times to loosen the powder. Measure 94 mL of water in a graduated cylinder. Add approximately half the total amount of water for reconstitution to the bottle and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute. Add the remainder of water and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute. Remove the child-resistant cap and push bottle adapter into neck of bottle. Close bottle with child-resistant cap tightly. This will assure the proper seating of the bottle adapter in the bottle and child-resistant status of the cap. Write the date of expiration of the constituted suspension on the bottle label. (The shelf-life of the constituted suspension is 60 days.) Dispense with the ""Instruction for Use"" and oral dispensers. Alert patients to read the important handling information described in the instructions for use. Store reconstituted suspension at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Storage in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) is acceptable. Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion 60 days after constitution. CELLCEPT Intravenous Before proceeding with the preparation steps for CELLCEPT Intravenous read the general preparation instructions [see General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations ] and note the following: CELLCEPT Intravenous does not contain an antibacterial preservative; therefore, reconstitution and dilution of the product must be performed under aseptic conditions. This product is sealed under vacuum and should retain a vacuum throughout its shelf life. If a lack of vacuum in the vial is noted while adding the diluent, the vial should not be used. CELLCEPT Intravenous must be reconstituted and further diluted. A detailed description of the preparation is given below. Table 4 Preparation Instructions of CELLCEPT Intravenous for Pharmacists Preparation of the 1g dose Reconstitute two (2) vials of CELLCEPT Intravenous by injecting 14 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection USP into each vial. Gently shake the vial to dissolve the drug. Inspect the resulting slightly yellow solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to further dilution. Discard the vials if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Dilute the contents of the two reconstituted vials (approximately 2 × 15 mL) into 140 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection USP. Inspect the resulting infusion solution and discard if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Preparation of the 1.5 g dose Reconstitute three (3) vials of CELLCEPT Intravenous by injecting 14 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection USP into each vial. Gently shake the vial to dissolve the drug. Inspect the resulting slightly yellow solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to further dilution. Discard the vials if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Dilute the contents of the three reconstituted vials (approximately 3 × 15 mL) into 210 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection USP. Inspect the resulting infusion solution and discard if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. The administration of the infusion should be initiated within 4 hours of reconstitution and dilution of the drug product. Keep solutions at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Discard unused portion of the reconstituted solutions. CELLCEPT Injection should not be mixed or administered concurrently via the same infusion catheter with other intravenous drugs or infusion admixtures.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE CELLCEPT [mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)] is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection, in adult and pediatric recipients 3 months of age and older of allogeneic kidney [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], heart [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] or liver transplants [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , in combination with other immunosuppressants. CELLCEPT is an antimetabolite immunosuppressant indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult and pediatric recipients 3 months of age and older of allogeneic kidney, heart or liver transplants, in combination with other immunosuppressants. ( 1 )","10 OVERDOSAGE Possible signs and symptoms of acute overdose include hematological abnormalities such as leukopenia and neutropenia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia. The experience with overdose of CELLCEPT in humans is limited. The reported effects associated with overdose fall within the known safety profile of the drug. The highest dose administered to kidney transplant patients in clinical trials has been 4 g/day. In limited experience with heart and liver transplant patients in clinical trials, the highest doses used were 4 g/day or 5 g/day. At doses of 4 g/day or 5 g/day, there appears to be a higher rate, compared to the use of 3 g/day or less, of gastrointestinal intolerance (nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea), and occasional hematologic abnormalities, particularly neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Treatment and Management MPA and the phenolic glucuronide metabolite of MPA (MPAG) are usually not removed by hemodialysis. However, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (>100 µg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are removed. By increasing excretion of the drug, MPA can be removed by bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].","Genentech, Inc.",MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL

CELLCEPT Capsules, Tablets and Oral Suspension CELLCEPT oral dosage forms (capsules, tablets or oral suspension) should not be used interchangeably with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets without supervision of a physician with experience in immunosuppressive therapy because the rates of absorption following the administration of CELLCEPT oral dosage forms and mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not equivalent. CELLCEPT tablets should not be crushed and CELLCEPT capsules should not be opened or crushed. Patients should avoid inhalation or contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the powder contained in CELLCEPT capsules and oral suspension. If such contact occurs, they must wash the area of contact thoroughly with soap and water. In case of ocular contact, rinse eyes with plain water. The initial oral dose of CELLCEPT should be given as soon as possible following kidney, heart or liver transplant. It is recommended that CELLCEPT be administered on an empty stomach. In stable transplant patients, however, CELLCEPT may be administered with food if necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Once reconstituted, CELLCEPT Oral Suspension must not be mixed with any liquids prior to dose administration. If needed, CELLCEPT Oral Suspension can be administered via a nasogastric tube with a minimum size of 8 French (minimum 1.7 mm interior diameter). Patients should be instructed to take a missed dose as soon as they remember, except if it is closer than 2 hours to the next scheduled dose; in this case, they should continue to take CELLCEPT at the usual times. CELLCEPT Intravenous CELLCEPT Intravenous is recommended for patients unable to take oral CELLCEPT. CELLCEPT Intravenous should be administered within 24 hours following transplant. CELLCEPT Intravenous can be administered for up to 14 days; however, patients should be switched to oral CELLCEPT as soon as they can tolerate oral medication. CELLCEPT Intravenous must be reconstituted before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . CELLCEPT Intravenous is incompatible with other intravenous infusion solutions and should not be mixed or administered concurrently via the same infusion catheter with other intravenous drugs or infusion admixtures. CELLCEPT Intravenous must not be administered as a bolus. Following reconstitution, CELLCEPT Intravenous must be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a period of no less than 2 hours by either peripheral or central vein, as rapid infusion increases the risk of local adverse reactions such as phlebitis and thrombosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Kidney Transplant Patients Adults The recommended dosage for adult kidney transplant patients is 1 g orally or intravenously infused over no less than 2 hours, twice daily (total daily dose of 2 g). Pediatrics (3 months and older) Pediatric dosing is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dosage of CELLCEPT oral suspension for pediatric kidney transplant patients 3 months and older is 600 mg/m 2 , administered twice daily (maximum total daily dose of 2 g or 10 mL of the oral suspension). Pediatric patients with BSA ≥ 1.25 m 2 may be dosed with capsules or tablets as follows: Table 1 Pediatric Kidney Transplant: Dosage Using Capsules or Tablets Body Surface Area Dosage 1.25 m 2 to <1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsule 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g total daily dose) ≥ 1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsules or tablets 1 g twice daily (2 g total daily dose) 2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Heart Transplant Patients Adults The recommended dosage of CELLCEPT for adult heart transplant patients is 1.5 g orally or intravenously infused over no less than 2 hours administered twice daily (total daily dose of 3 g). Pediatrics (3 months and older) The recommended starting dosage of CELLCEPT oral suspension for pediatric heart transplant patients 3 months and older is 600 mg/m 2 , administered twice daily. If well tolerated, the dose can be increased to a maintenance dosage of 900 mg/m 2 twice daily (maximum total daily dose of 3 g or 15 mL of the oral suspension). The dose may be individualized based on clinical assessment. Pediatric patients with BSA ≥1.25 m 2 may be started on therapy with capsules or tablets as follows: Table 2 Pediatric Heart Transplant: Pediatric Starting Dosage Using Capsules or Tablets Body Surface Area Starting Dosage Maximum maintenance dose: 3 g total daily. 1.25 m 2 to <1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsule 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g total daily dose) ≥ 1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsules or tablets 1 g twice daily (2 g total daily dose) 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Liver Transplant Patients Adults The recommended dosage of CELLCEPT for adult liver transplant patients is 1.5 g administered orally twice daily (total daily dose of 3 g) or 1 g infused intravenously over no less than 2 hours, twice daily (total daily dose of 2 g). Pediatrics (3 months and older) The recommended starting dosage of CELLCEPT oral suspension for pediatric liver transplant patients 3 months of age and older is 600 mg/m 2 , administered twice daily. If well tolerated, the dose can be increased to a maintenance dosage of 900 mg/m 2 twice daily (maximum total daily dose of 3 g or 15 mL of the oral suspension). The dose may be individualized based on clinical assessment. Pediatric patients with BSA ≥1.25 m 2 may be started on therapy with capsules or tablets as follows: Table 3 Pediatric Liver Transplant: Pediatric Starting Dosage Using Capsules or Tablets Body Surface Area Starting Dosage Maximum maintenance dose: 3 g total daily. 1.25 m 2 to <1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsule 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g total daily dose) ≥ 1.5 m 2 CELLCEPT capsules or tablets 1 g twice daily (2 g total daily dose) 2.5 Dosage Modifications: Patients with Renal Impairment, Neutropenia Renal Impairment No dosage modifications are needed in kidney transplant patients with delayed graft function postoperatively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In kidney transplant patients with severe chronic impairment of the graft (GFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), do not administer doses of CELLCEPT greater than 1 g twice a day. These patients should be carefully monitored [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Neutropenia If neutropenia develops (ANC <1.3 × 10 3 /µL), dosing with CELLCEPT should be interrupted or reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 2.6 Preparation Instructions of Oral Suspension and Intravenous for Pharmacists General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has demonstrated teratogenic effects in humans. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1) ]. Care should be taken to avoid inhalation or direct contact with skin or mucous membranes of the dry powder or the constituted suspension because MMF has demonstrated teratogenic effects in humans . Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the bottle/cap and the table surface after reconstitution. If such contact occurs, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes with water. Alert patients that they and others should also avoid inhalation or contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the oral suspension. Advise them to wash the area thoroughly with soap and water if such contact occurs; if ocular contact occurs, rinse eyes with plain water. CELLCEPT Oral Suspension CELLCEPT Oral Suspension must be reconstituted by the pharmacist prior to dispensing to the patient. CELLCEPT Oral Suspension should not be mixed with any other medication. After reconstitution, the oral suspension contains 200 mg/mL MMF. Before proceeding with the reconstitution steps read the general preparation instructions above [see General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations ]. The following are the steps for reconstitution: Tap the closed bottle several times to loosen the powder. Measure 94 mL of water in a graduated cylinder. Add approximately half the total amount of water for reconstitution to the bottle and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute. Add the remainder of water and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute. Remove the child-resistant cap and push bottle adapter into neck of bottle. Close bottle with child-resistant cap tightly. This will assure the proper seating of the bottle adapter in the bottle and child-resistant status of the cap. Write the date of expiration of the constituted suspension on the bottle label. (The shelf-life of the constituted suspension is 60 days.) Dispense with the ""Instruction for Use"" and oral dispensers. Alert patients to read the important handling information described in the instructions for use. Store reconstituted suspension at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Storage in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) is acceptable. Do not freeze. Discard any unused portion 60 days after constitution. CELLCEPT Intravenous Before proceeding with the preparation steps for CELLCEPT Intravenous read the general preparation instructions [see General Preparation Instructions Before Handling the Formulations ] and note the following: CELLCEPT Intravenous does not contain an antibacterial preservative; therefore, reconstitution and dilution of the product must be performed under aseptic conditions. This product is sealed under vacuum and should retain a vacuum throughout its shelf life. If a lack of vacuum in the vial is noted while adding the diluent, the vial should not be used. CELLCEPT Intravenous must be reconstituted and further diluted. A detailed description of the preparation is given below. Table 4 Preparation Instructions of CELLCEPT Intravenous for Pharmacists Preparation of the 1g dose Reconstitute two (2) vials of CELLCEPT Intravenous by injecting 14 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection USP into each vial. Gently shake the vial to dissolve the drug. Inspect the resulting slightly yellow solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to further dilution. Discard the vials if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Dilute the contents of the two reconstituted vials (approximately 2 × 15 mL) into 140 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection USP. Inspect the resulting infusion solution and discard if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Preparation of the 1.5 g dose Reconstitute three (3) vials of CELLCEPT Intravenous by injecting 14 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection USP into each vial. Gently shake the vial to dissolve the drug. Inspect the resulting slightly yellow solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to further dilution. Discard the vials if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Dilute the contents of the three reconstituted vials (approximately 3 × 15 mL) into 210 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection USP. Inspect the resulting infusion solution and discard if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. The administration of the infusion should be initiated within 4 hours of reconstitution and dilution of the drug product. Keep solutions at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Discard unused portion of the reconstituted solutions. CELLCEPT Injection should not be mixed or administered concurrently via the same infusion catheter with other intravenous drugs or infusion admixtures.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE CELLCEPT [mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)] is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection, in adult and pediatric recipients 3 months of age and older of allogeneic kidney [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], heart [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] or liver transplants [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] , in combination with other immunosuppressants. CELLCEPT is an antimetabolite immunosuppressant indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult and pediatric recipients 3 months of age and older of allogeneic kidney, heart or liver transplants, in combination with other immunosuppressants. ( 1 )","10 OVERDOSAGE Possible signs and symptoms of acute overdose include hematological abnormalities such as leukopenia and neutropenia, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia. The experience with overdose of CELLCEPT in humans is limited. The reported effects associated with overdose fall within the known safety profile of the drug. The highest dose administered to kidney transplant patients in clinical trials has been 4 g/day. In limited experience with heart and liver transplant patients in clinical trials, the highest doses used were 4 g/day or 5 g/day. At doses of 4 g/day or 5 g/day, there appears to be a higher rate, compared to the use of 3 g/day or less, of gastrointestinal intolerance (nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea), and occasional hematologic abnormalities, particularly neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Treatment and Management MPA and the phenolic glucuronide metabolite of MPA (MPAG) are usually not removed by hemodialysis. However, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (>100 µg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are removed. By increasing excretion of the drug, MPA can be removed by bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].","Genentech, Inc.",MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL
MELPHALAN,43,801,Pneumonia,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The usual IV dose is 16 mg/m 2 . Dosage reduction of up to 50% should be considered in patients with renal insufficiency (BUN ≥30 mg/dL) (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). The drug is administered as a single infusion over 15 to 20 minutes. Melphalan hydrochloride for injection is administered at 2-week intervals for 4 doses, then, after adequate recovery from toxicity, at 4-week intervals. Available evidence suggests about one third to one half of the patients with multiple myeloma show a favorable response to the drug. Experience with oral melphalan suggests that repeated courses should be given since improvement may continue slowly over many months, and the maximum benefit may be missed if treatment is abandoned prematurely. Dose adjustment on the basis of blood cell counts at the nadir and day of treatment should be considered. Administration Precautions As with other toxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling and preparing the solution of melphalan hydrochloride for injection. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure may occur. The use of gloves is recommended. If the solution of melphalan hydrochloride for injection contacts the skin or mucosa, immediately wash the skin or mucosa thoroughly with soap and water. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 1-8 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate. Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. If either occurs, do not use this product. Care should be taken to avoid possible extravasation of melphalan and in cases of poor peripheral venous access, consideration should be given to use of a central venous line (see WARNINGS) . Preparation for Administration/Stability 1.Melphalan hydrochloride for injection must be reconstituted by rapidly injecting 10 mL of the supplied diluent directly into the vial of lyophilized powder using a sterile needle (20-gauge or larger needle diameter) and syringe. Immediately shake vial vigorously until a clear solution is obtained. This provides a 5 mg/mL solution of melphalan. Rapid addition of the diluent followed by immediate vigorous shaking is important for proper dissolution. 2. Immediately dilute the dose to be administered in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a concentration not greater than 0.45 mg/mL. 3. Administer the diluted product over a minimum of 15 minutes. 4. Complete administration within 60 minutes of reconstitution. The time between reconstitution/dilution and administration of melphalan hydrochloride for injection should be kept to a minimum because reconstituted and diluted solutions of melphalan hydrochloride for injection are unstable. Over as short a time as 30 minutes, a citrate derivative of melphalan has been detected in reconstituted material from the reaction of melphalan hydrochloride for injection with Sterile Diluent for melphalan hydrochloride for injection. Upon further dilution with saline, nearly 1% label strength of melphalan hydrolyzes every 10 minutes. A precipitate forms if the reconstituted solution is stored at 5°C. DO NOT REFRIGERATE THE RECONSTITUTED PRODUCT.",INDICATIONS AND USAGE Melphalan hydrochloride for injection is indicated for the palliative treatment of patients with multiple myeloma for whom oral therapy is not appropriate.,"OVERDOSAGE Overdoses resulting in death have been reported. Overdoses, including doses up to 290 mg/m 2 , have produced the following symptoms: severe nausea and vomiting, decreased consciousness, convulsions, muscular paralysis, and cholinomimetic effects. Severe mucositis, stomatitis, colitis, diarrhea, and hemorrhage of the gastrointestinal tract occur at high doses (>100 mg/m 2 ). Elevations in liver enzymes and veno-occlusive disease occur infrequently. Significant hyponatremia caused by an associated inappropriate secretion of ADH syndrome has been observed. Nephrotoxicity and adult respiratory distress syndrome have been reported rarely. The principal toxic effect is bone marrow suppression. Hematologic parameters should be closely followed for 3 to 6 weeks. An uncontrolled study suggests that administration of autologous bone marrow or hematopoietic growth factors (i.e., sargramostim, filgrastim) may shorten the period of pancytopenia. General supportive measures together with appropriate blood transfusions and antibiotics should be instituted as deemed necessary by the physician. This drug is not removed from plasma to any significant degree by hemodialysis or hemoperfusion.

NEORAL,43,801,Pneumonia,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Neoral Soft Gelatin Capsules (cyclosporine capsules, USP) MODIFIED and Neoral Oral Solution (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) MODIFIED Neoral has increased bioavailability in comparison to Sandimmune. Neoral and Sandimmune are not bioequivalent and cannot be used interchangeably without physician supervision. The daily dose of Neoral should always be given in two divided doses (BID). It is recommended that Neoral be administered on a consistent schedule with regard to time of day and relation to meals. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice affect metabolism, increasing blood concentration of cyclosporine, thus should be avoided. Specific Populations Renal Impairment in Kidney, Liver, and Heart Transplantation Cyclosporine undergoes minimal renal elimination and its pharmacokinetics do not appear to be significantly altered in patients with end-stage renal disease who receive routine hemodialysis treatments (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) . However, due to its nephrotoxic potential (see WARNINGS) , careful monitoring of renal function is recommended; cyclosporine dosage should be reduced if indicated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) . Renal Impairment in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriasis Patients with impaired renal function should not receive cyclosporine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) . Hepatic Impairment The clearance of cyclosporine may be significantly reduced in severe liver disease patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) . Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment to maintain blood concentrations within the recommended target range (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) . Newly Transplanted Patients The initial oral dose of Neoral can be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation or be given postoperatively. The initial dose of Neoral varies depending on the transplanted organ and the other immunosuppressive agents included in the immunosuppressive protocol. In newly transplanted patients, the initial oral dose of Neoral is the same as the initial oral dose of Sandimmune. Suggested initial doses are available from the results of a 1994 survey of the use of Sandimmune in US transplant centers. The mean ± SD initial doses were 9 ± 3 mg/kg/day for renal transplant patients (75 centers), 8 ± 4 mg/kg/day for liver transplant patients (30 centers), and 7 ± 3 mg/kg/day for heart transplant patients (24 centers). Total daily doses were divided into two equal daily doses. The Neoral dose is subsequently adjusted to achieve a pre-defined cyclosporine blood concentration (see Blood Concentration Monitoring in Transplant Patients , below). If cyclosporine trough blood concentrations are used, the target range is the same for Neoral as for Sandimmune. Using the same trough concentration target range for Neoral as for Sandimmune results in greater cyclosporine exposure when Neoral is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption) . Dosing should be titrated based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability. Lower Neoral doses may be sufficient as maintenance therapy. Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended initially. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A representative dosage schedule based on the patient’s weight started with 2.0 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on status of patient and function of graft. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation. Conversion from Sandimmune to Neoral in Transplant Patients In transplanted patients who are considered for conversion to Neoral from Sandimmune, Neoral should be started with the same daily dose as was previously used with Sandimmune (1:1 dose conversion). The Neoral dose should subsequently be adjusted to attain the pre-conversion cyclosporine blood trough concentration. Using the same trough concentration target range for Neoral as for Sandimmune results in greater cyclosporine exposure when Neoral is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption) . Patients with suspected poor absorption of Sandimmune require different dosing strategies (see Transplant Patients with Poor Absorption of Sandimmune, below) . In some patients, the increase in blood trough concentration is more pronounced and may be of clinical significance. Until the blood trough concentration attains the pre-conversion value, it is strongly recommended that the cyclosporine blood trough concentration be monitored every 4 to 7 days after conversion to Neoral. In addition, clinical safety parameters, such as serum creatinine and blood pressure, should be monitored every two weeks during the first two months after conversion. If the blood trough concentrations are outside the desired range and/or if the clinical safety parameters worsen, the dosage of Neoral must be adjusted accordingly. Transplant Patients with Poor Absorption of Sandimmune Patients with lower than expected cyclosporine blood trough concentrations in relation to the oral dose of Sandimmune may have poor or inconsistent absorption of cyclosporine from Sandimmune. After conversion to Neoral, patients tend to have higher cyclosporine concentrations. Due to the increase in bioavailability of cyclosporine following conversion to Neoral, the cyclosporine blood trough concentration may exceed the target range. Particular caution should be exercised when converting patients to Neoral at doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day. The dose of Neoral should be titrated individually based on cyclosporine trough concentrations, tolerability, and clinical response. In this population the cyclosporine blood trough concentration should be measured more frequently, at least twice a week (daily, if initial dose exceeds 10 mg/kg/day) until the concentration stabilizes within the desired range. Rheumatoid Arthritis The initial dose of Neoral is 2.5 mg/kg/day, taken twice daily as a divided (BID) oral dose. Salicylates, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids may be continued (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions) . Onset of action generally occurs between 4 and 8 weeks. If insufficient clinical benefit is seen and tolerability is good (including serum creatinine less than 30% above baseline), the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg/day after 8 weeks and again after 12 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg/kg/day. If no benefit is seen by 16 weeks of therapy, Neoral therapy should be discontinued. Dose decreases by 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, e.g., hypertension elevations in serum creatinine (30% above patient’s pretreatment level) or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) . If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, Neoral should be discontinued. The same initial dose and dosage range should be used if Neoral is combined with the recommended dose of methotrexate. Most patients can be treated with Neoral doses of 3 mg/kg/day or below when combined with methotrexate doses of up to 15 mg/week (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials) . There is limited long-term treatment data. Recurrence of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is generally apparent within 4 weeks after stopping cyclosporine. Psoriasis The initial dose of Neoral should be 2.5 mg/kg/day. Neoral should be taken twice daily, as a divided (1.25 mg/kg BID) oral dose. Patients should be kept at that dose for at least 4 weeks, barring adverse events. If significant clinical improvement has not occurred in patients by that time, the patient’s dosage should be increased at 2-week intervals. Based on patient response, dose increases of approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day should be made to a maximum of 4.0 mg/kg/day. Dose decreases by 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, e.g., hypertension, elevations in serum creatinine (≥ 25% above the patient’s pretreatment level), or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities, or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, Neoral should be discontinued (see Special Monitoring of Psoriasis Patients) . Patients generally show some improvement in the clinical manifestations of psoriasis in 2 weeks. Satisfactory control and stabilization of the disease may take 12 to 16 weeks to achieve. Results of a dose-titration clinical trial with Neoral indicate that an improvement of psoriasis by 75% or more (based on PASI) was achieved in 51% of the patients after 8 weeks and in 79% of the patients after 16 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued if satisfactory response cannot be achieved after 6 weeks at 4 mg/kg/day or the patient’s maximum tolerated dose. Once a patient is adequately controlled and appears stable the dose of Neoral should be lowered, and the patient treated with the lowest dose that maintains an adequate response (this should not necessarily be total clearing of the patient). In clinical trials, cyclosporine doses at the lower end of the recommended dosage range were effective in maintaining a satisfactory response in 60% of the patients. Doses below 2.5 mg/kg/day may also be equally effective. Upon stopping treatment with cyclosporine, relapse will occur in approximately 6 weeks (50% of the patients) to 16 weeks (75% of the patients). In the majority of patients rebound does not occur after cessation of treatment with cyclosporine. Thirteen cases of transformation of chronic plaque psoriasis to more severe forms of psoriasis have been reported. There were 9 cases of pustular and 4 cases of erythrodermic psoriasis. Long term experience with Neoral in psoriasis patients is limited and continuous treatment for extended periods greater than one year is not recommended. Alternation with other forms of treatment should be considered in the long-term management of patients with this lifelong disease. Neoral Oral Solution (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) MODIFIED–Recommendations for Administration To make Neoral Oral Solution (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) MODIFIED more palatable, it should be diluted with orange or apple juice that is at room temperature. Patients should avoid switching diluents frequently. Grapefruit juice affects metabolism of cyclosporine and should be avoided. The combination of Neoral solution with milk can be unpalatable. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cyclosporine when administered as Neoral Oral Solution has not been evaluated. Take the prescribed amount of Neoral Oral Solution (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) MODIFIED from the container using the dosing syringe supplied, after removal of the protective cover, and transfer the solution to a glass of orange or apple juice. Stir well and drink at once. Do not allow diluted oral solution to stand before drinking. Use a glass container (not plastic). Rinse the glass with more diluent to ensure that the total dose is consumed. After use, dry the outside of the dosing syringe with a clean towel and replace the protective cover. Do not rinse the dosing syringe with water or other cleaning agents. If the syringe requires cleaning, it must be completely dry before resuming use. Blood Concentration Monitoring in Transplant Patients Transplant centers have found blood concentration monitoring of cyclosporine to be an essential component of patient management. Of importance to blood concentration analysis are the type of assay used, the transplanted organ, and other immunosuppressant agents being administered. While no fixed relationship has been established, blood concentration monitoring may assist in the clinical evaluation of rejection and toxicity, dose adjustments, and the assessment of compliance. Various assays have been used to measure blood concentrations of cyclosporine. Older studies using a nonspecific assay often cited concentrations that were roughly twice those of the specific assays. Therefore, comparison between concentrations in the published literature and an individual patient concentration using current assays must be made with detailed knowledge of the assay methods employed. Current assay results are also not interchangeable and their use should be guided by their approved labeling. A discussion of the different assay methods is contained in Annals of Clinical Biochemistry 1994; 31:420-446. While several assays and assay matrices are available, there is a consensus that parent-compound-specific assays correlate best with clinical events. Of these, HPLC is the standard reference, but the monoclonal antibody RIAs and the monoclonal antibody FPIA offer sensitivity, reproducibility, and convenience. Most clinicians base their monitoring on trough cyclosporine concentrations. Applied Pharmacokinetics, Principles of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (1992) contains a broad discussion of cyclosporine pharmacokinetics and drug monitoring techniques. Blood concentration monitoring is not a replacement for renal function monitoring or tissue biopsies.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Kidney, Liver, and Heart Transplantation Neoral is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart allogeneic transplants. Neoral has been used in combination with azathioprine and corticosteroids. Rheumatoid Arthritis Neoral is indicated for the treatment of patients with severe active, rheumatoid arthritis where the disease has not adequately responded to methotrexate. Neoral can be used in combination with methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients who do not respond adequately to methotrexate alone. Psoriasis Neoral is indicated for the treatment of adult, nonimmunocompromised patients with severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling), recalcitrant, plaque psoriasis who have failed to respond to at least one systemic therapy (e.g., PUVA, retinoids, or methotrexate) or in patients for whom other systemic therapies are contraindicated or cannot be tolerated. While rebound rarely occurs, most patients will experience relapse with Neoral as with other therapies upon cessation of treatment.","OVERDOSAGE There is a minimal experience with cyclosporine overdosage. Forced emesis and gastric lavage can be of value up to 2 hours after administration of Neoral. Transient hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur which should resolve following drug withdrawal. Oral doses of cyclosporine up to 10 g (about 150 mg/kg) have been tolerated with relatively minor clinical consequences, such as vomiting, drowsiness, headache, tachycardia and, in a few patients, moderately severe, reversible impairment of renal function. However, serious symptoms of intoxication have been reported following accidental parenteral overdosage with cyclosporine in premature neonates. General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be followed in all cases of overdosage. Cyclosporine is not dialyzable to any great extent, nor is it cleared well by charcoal hemoperfusion. The oral dosage at which half of experimental animals are estimated to die is 31 times, 39 times, and > 54 times the human maintenance dose for transplant patients (6mg/kg; corrections based on body surface area) in mice, rats, and rabbits.",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,CYCLOSPORINE

Specific Populations Renal Impairment in Kidney, Liver, and Heart Transplantation Cyclosporine undergoes minimal renal elimination and its pharmacokinetics do not appear to be significantly altered in patients with end-stage renal disease who receive routine hemodialysis treatments (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) . However, due to its nephrotoxic potential (see WARNINGS) , careful monitoring of renal function is recommended; cyclosporine dosage should be reduced if indicated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) . Renal Impairment in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriasis Patients with impaired renal function should not receive cyclosporine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) . Hepatic Impairment The clearance of cyclosporine may be significantly reduced in severe liver disease patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) . Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment to maintain blood concentrations within the recommended target range (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) . Newly Transplanted Patients The initial oral dose of Neoral can be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation or be given postoperatively. The initial dose of Neoral varies depending on the transplanted organ and the other immunosuppressive agents included in the immunosuppressive protocol. In newly transplanted patients, the initial oral dose of Neoral is the same as the initial oral dose of Sandimmune. Suggested initial doses are available from the results of a 1994 survey of the use of Sandimmune in US transplant centers. The mean ± SD initial doses were 9 ± 3 mg/kg/day for renal transplant patients (75 centers), 8 ± 4 mg/kg/day for liver transplant patients (30 centers), and 7 ± 3 mg/kg/day for heart transplant patients (24 centers). Total daily doses were divided into two equal daily doses. The Neoral dose is subsequently adjusted to achieve a pre-defined cyclosporine blood concentration (see Blood Concentration Monitoring in Transplant Patients , below). If cyclosporine trough blood concentrations are used, the target range is the same for Neoral as for Sandimmune. Using the same trough concentration target range for Neoral as for Sandimmune results in greater cyclosporine exposure when Neoral is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption) . Dosing should be titrated based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability. Lower Neoral doses may be sufficient as maintenance therapy. Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended initially. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A representative dosage schedule based on the patient’s weight started with 2.0 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on status of patient and function of graft. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation. Conversion from Sandimmune to Neoral in Transplant Patients In transplanted patients who are considered for conversion to Neoral from Sandimmune, Neoral should be started with the same daily dose as was previously used with Sandimmune (1:1 dose conversion). The Neoral dose should subsequently be adjusted to attain the pre-conversion cyclosporine blood trough concentration. Using the same trough concentration target range for Neoral as for Sandimmune results in greater cyclosporine exposure when Neoral is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption) . Patients with suspected poor absorption of Sandimmune require different dosing strategies (see Transplant Patients with Poor Absorption of Sandimmune, below) . In some patients, the increase in blood trough concentration is more pronounced and may be of clinical significance. Until the blood trough concentration attains the pre-conversion value, it is strongly recommended that the cyclosporine blood trough concentration be monitored every 4 to 7 days after conversion to Neoral. In addition, clinical safety parameters, such as serum creatinine and blood pressure, should be monitored every two weeks during the first two months after conversion. If the blood trough concentrations are outside the desired range and/or if the clinical safety parameters worsen, the dosage of Neoral must be adjusted accordingly. Transplant Patients with Poor Absorption of Sandimmune Patients with lower than expected cyclosporine blood trough concentrations in relation to the oral dose of Sandimmune may have poor or inconsistent absorption of cyclosporine from Sandimmune. After conversion to Neoral, patients tend to have higher cyclosporine concentrations. Due to the increase in bioavailability of cyclosporine following conversion to Neoral, the cyclosporine blood trough concentration may exceed the target range. Particular caution should be exercised when converting patients to Neoral at doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day. The dose of Neoral should be titrated individually based on cyclosporine trough concentrations, tolerability, and clinical response. In this population the cyclosporine blood trough concentration should be measured more frequently, at least twice a week (daily, if initial dose exceeds 10 mg/kg/day) until the concentration stabilizes within the desired range. Rheumatoid Arthritis The initial dose of Neoral is 2.5 mg/kg/day, taken twice daily as a divided (BID) oral dose. Salicylates, NSAIDs, and oral corticosteroids may be continued (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions) . Onset of action generally occurs between 4 and 8 weeks. If insufficient clinical benefit is seen and tolerability is good (including serum creatinine less than 30% above baseline), the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg/day after 8 weeks and again after 12 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg/kg/day. If no benefit is seen by 16 weeks of therapy, Neoral therapy should be discontinued. Dose decreases by 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, e.g., hypertension elevations in serum creatinine (30% above patient’s pretreatment level) or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) . If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, Neoral should be discontinued. The same initial dose and dosage range should be used if Neoral is combined with the recommended dose of methotrexate. Most patients can be treated with Neoral doses of 3 mg/kg/day or below when combined with methotrexate doses of up to 15 mg/week (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials) . There is limited long-term treatment data. Recurrence of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity is generally apparent within 4 weeks after stopping cyclosporine. Psoriasis The initial dose of Neoral should be 2.5 mg/kg/day. Neoral should be taken twice daily, as a divided (1.25 mg/kg BID) oral dose. Patients should be kept at that dose for at least 4 weeks, barring adverse events. If significant clinical improvement has not occurred in patients by that time, the patient’s dosage should be increased at 2-week intervals. Based on patient response, dose increases of approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day should be made to a maximum of 4.0 mg/kg/day. Dose decreases by 25% to 50% should be made at any time to control adverse events, e.g., hypertension, elevations in serum creatinine (≥ 25% above the patient’s pretreatment level), or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. If dose reduction is not effective in controlling abnormalities, or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, Neoral should be discontinued (see Special Monitoring of Psoriasis Patients) . Patients generally show some improvement in the clinical manifestations of psoriasis in 2 weeks. Satisfactory control and stabilization of the disease may take 12 to 16 weeks to achieve. Results of a dose-titration clinical trial with Neoral indicate that an improvement of psoriasis by 75% or more (based on PASI) was achieved in 51% of the patients after 8 weeks and in 79% of the patients after 16 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued if satisfactory response cannot be achieved after 6 weeks at 4 mg/kg/day or the patient’s maximum tolerated dose. Once a patient is adequately controlled and appears stable the dose of Neoral should be lowered, and the patient treated with the lowest dose that maintains an adequate response (this should not necessarily be total clearing of the patient). In clinical trials, cyclosporine doses at the lower end of the recommended dosage range were effective in maintaining a satisfactory response in 60% of the patients. Doses below 2.5 mg/kg/day may also be equally effective. Upon stopping treatment with cyclosporine, relapse will occur in approximately 6 weeks (50% of the patients) to 16 weeks (75% of the patients). In the majority of patients rebound does not occur after cessation of treatment with cyclosporine. Thirteen cases of transformation of chronic plaque psoriasis to more severe forms of psoriasis have been reported. There were 9 cases of pustular and 4 cases of erythrodermic psoriasis. Long term experience with Neoral in psoriasis patients is limited and continuous treatment for extended periods greater than one year is not recommended. Alternation with other forms of treatment should be considered in the long-term management of patients with this lifelong disease. Neoral Oral Solution (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) MODIFIED–Recommendations for Administration To make Neoral Oral Solution (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) MODIFIED more palatable, it should be diluted with orange or apple juice that is at room temperature. Patients should avoid switching diluents frequently. Grapefruit juice affects metabolism of cyclosporine and should be avoided. The combination of Neoral solution with milk can be unpalatable. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cyclosporine when administered as Neoral Oral Solution has not been evaluated. Take the prescribed amount of Neoral Oral Solution (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) MODIFIED from the container using the dosing syringe supplied, after removal of the protective cover, and transfer the solution to a glass of orange or apple juice. Stir well and drink at once. Do not allow diluted oral solution to stand before drinking. Use a glass container (not plastic). Rinse the glass with more diluent to ensure that the total dose is consumed. After use, dry the outside of the dosing syringe with a clean towel and replace the protective cover. Do not rinse the dosing syringe with water or other cleaning agents. If the syringe requires cleaning, it must be completely dry before resuming use. Blood Concentration Monitoring in Transplant Patients Transplant centers have found blood concentration monitoring of cyclosporine to be an essential component of patient management. Of importance to blood concentration analysis are the type of assay used, the transplanted organ, and other immunosuppressant agents being administered. While no fixed relationship has been established, blood concentration monitoring may assist in the clinical evaluation of rejection and toxicity, dose adjustments, and the assessment of compliance. Various assays have been used to measure blood concentrations of cyclosporine. Older studies using a nonspecific assay often cited concentrations that were roughly twice those of the specific assays. Therefore, comparison between concentrations in the published literature and an individual patient concentration using current assays must be made with detailed knowledge of the assay methods employed. Current assay results are also not interchangeable and their use should be guided by their approved labeling. A discussion of the different assay methods is contained in Annals of Clinical Biochemistry 1994; 31:420-446. While several assays and assay matrices are available, there is a consensus that parent-compound-specific assays correlate best with clinical events. Of these, HPLC is the standard reference, but the monoclonal antibody RIAs and the monoclonal antibody FPIA offer sensitivity, reproducibility, and convenience. Most clinicians base their monitoring on trough cyclosporine concentrations. Applied Pharmacokinetics, Principles of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (1992) contains a broad discussion of cyclosporine pharmacokinetics and drug monitoring techniques. Blood concentration monitoring is not a replacement for renal function monitoring or tissue biopsies.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Kidney, Liver, and Heart Transplantation Neoral is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney, liver, and heart allogeneic transplants. Neoral has been used in combination with azathioprine and corticosteroids. Rheumatoid Arthritis Neoral is indicated for the treatment of patients with severe active, rheumatoid arthritis where the disease has not adequately responded to methotrexate. Neoral can be used in combination with methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients who do not respond adequately to methotrexate alone. Psoriasis Neoral is indicated for the treatment of adult, nonimmunocompromised patients with severe (i.e., extensive and/or disabling), recalcitrant, plaque psoriasis who have failed to respond to at least one systemic therapy (e.g., PUVA, retinoids, or methotrexate) or in patients for whom other systemic therapies are contraindicated or cannot be tolerated. While rebound rarely occurs, most patients will experience relapse with Neoral as with other therapies upon cessation of treatment.","OVERDOSAGE There is a minimal experience with cyclosporine overdosage. Forced emesis and gastric lavage can be of value up to 2 hours after administration of Neoral. Transient hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur which should resolve following drug withdrawal. Oral doses of cyclosporine up to 10 g (about 150 mg/kg) have been tolerated with relatively minor clinical consequences, such as vomiting, drowsiness, headache, tachycardia and, in a few patients, moderately severe, reversible impairment of renal function. However, serious symptoms of intoxication have been reported following accidental parenteral overdosage with cyclosporine in premature neonates. General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be followed in all cases of overdosage. Cyclosporine is not dialyzable to any great extent, nor is it cleared well by charcoal hemoperfusion. The oral dosage at which half of experimental animals are estimated to die is 31 times, 39 times, and > 54 times the human maintenance dose for transplant patients (6mg/kg; corrections based on body surface area) in mice, rats, and rabbits.",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,CYCLOSPORINE
PREDNISONE,43,801,Pneumonia,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT ® (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing’s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1¼ to 1½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1. Endocrine Disorders Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (hydrocortisone or cortisone is the first choice; synthetic analogs may be used in conjunction with mineralocorticoids where applicable; in infancy mineralocorticoid supplementation is of particular importance) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hypercalcemia associated with cancer Nonsuppurative thyroiditis 2. Rheumatic Disorders As adjunctive therapy for short-term administration (to tide the patient over an acute episode or exacerbation) in: Psoriatic arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (selected cases may require low-dose maintenance therapy) Ankylosing spondylitis Acute and subacute bursitis Acute nonspecific tenosynovitis Acute gouty arthritis Post-traumatic osteoarthritis Synovitis of osteoarthritis Epicondylitis 3.

Miscellaneous Tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement","WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

METOPROLOL,N/A,N/A,Seizure,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer once daily with food or after a meal. Titrate at weekly or longer intervals as needed and tolerated. ( 2 ) Hypertension: Recommended starting dosage is 100 mg daily, in single or divided doses. ( 2.1 ) Angina Pectoris: Recommended starting dosage is 100 mg daily, given as two divided doses. ( 2.2 ) Myocardial Infarction: The starting dosage depends upon tolerance of intravenous metoprolol, see full prescribing information. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Hypertension Individualize the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period. Larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. Measure blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day. 2.2 Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 2.3 Myocardial Infarction See prescribing information of intravenous metoprolol for dosage instructions for intravenous therapy. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose, initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose of metoprolol and continue for 48 hours. In the case of intolerance, reduce dose to 25 mg and administer for 48 hours. Titrate, based on tolerability, to a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol tartrate tablets beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metoprolol tartrate tablets are a beta-adrenergic blocker indicated for the treatment of: Hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1.1 ) Angina Pectoris. ( 1.2 ) Myocardial Infarction, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality when used in conjunction with intravenous metoprolol therapy in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction in hemodynamically stable patients. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Hypertension Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Metoprolol tartrate tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Angina Pectoris Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance. 1.3 Myocardial Infarction Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality when used alone or in conjunction with intravenous metoprolol.","10 OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms - Overdosage of metoprolol may lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. Clinical presentation can also include: atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness/coma, nausea and vomiting. Treatment – Consider treating the patient with intensive care. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability. Beta-blocker overdose may result in significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, employ the following measures. Hemodialysis is unlikely to make a useful contribution to metoprolol elimination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Bradycardia: Evaluate the need for atropine, adrenergic-stimulating drugs or pacemaker to treat bradycardia and conduction disorders. Hypotension: Treat underlying bradycardia. Consider intravenous vasopressor infusion, such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Heart failure and shock: May be treated when appropriate with suitable volume expansion, injection of glucagon (if necessary, followed by an intravenous infusion of glucagon), intravenous administration of adrenergic drugs such as dobutamine, with α 1 receptor agonistic drugs added in presence of vasodilation. Bronchospasm: Can usually be reversed by bronchodilators.","PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",METOPROLOL TARTRATE
VALPROATE,N/A,N/A,Seizure,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Valproate sodium injection is intended for intravenous use only. • Epilepsy o Complex Partial Seizures in Adults and Children 10 years of age or older: Initial dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1 week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response. Maximum recommended dose is 60 mg/kg/day ( 2.1 ). o Simple and Complex Absence Seizures: Initial dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1 week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response. Maximum recommended dose is 60 mg/kg/day ( 2.1 ). 2.1 Epilepsy Valproate sodium injection is for intravenous use only. Use of valproate sodium injection for periods of more than 14 days has not been studied. Patients should be switched to oral valproate products as soon as it is clinically feasible. Valproate sodium injection should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary. In one clinical safety study, approximately 90 patients with epilepsy and with no measurable plasma levels of valproate were given single infusions of valproate sodium injection (up to 15 mg/kg and mean dose of 1,184 mg) over 5 to 10 minutes (1.5 to 3 mg/kg/min). Patients generally tolerated the more rapid infusions well [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . This study was not designed to assess the effectiveness of these regimens. For pharmacokinetics with rapid infusions, see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ). Initial Exposure to Valproate The following dosage recommendations were obtained from studies utilizing oral divalproex sodium products. Complex Partial Seizures For adults and children 10 years of age or older. Monotherapy (Initial Therapy) Valproate sodium injection has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions. Conversion to Monotherapy Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of valproate sodium injection therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency. Adjunctive Therapy Valproate sodium injection may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses. In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Simple and Complex Absence Seizures The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses. A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . As the valproate sodium injection dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. Replacement Therapy When switching from oral valproate products, the total daily dose of valproate sodium injection should be equivalent to the total daily dose of the oral valproate product [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )] , and should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary. Patients receiving doses near the maximum recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg/day, particularly those not receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, should be monitored more closely. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in a divided regimen. There is no experience with more rapid infusions in patients receiving valproate sodium injection as replacement therapy. However, the equivalence shown between valproate sodium injection and oral valproate products (divalproex sodium) at steady state was only evaluated in an every 6 hour regimen. Whether, when valproate sodium injection is given less frequently (i.e., twice or three times a day), trough levels fall below those that result from an oral dosage form given via the same regimen, is unknown. For this reason, when valproate sodium injection is given twice or three times a day, close monitoring of trough plasma levels may be needed. 2.2 General Dosing Advice Dosing in Elderly Patients Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence. The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Dose-Related Adverse Reactions The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions. Administration Rapid infusion of valproate sodium injection has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions. There is limited experience with infusion times of less than 60 minutes or rates of infusion > 20 mg/min in patients with epilepsy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Valproate sodium injection should be administered intravenously as a 60 minute infusion, as noted above. It should be diluted with at least 50 mL of a compatible diluent. Any unused portion of the vial contents should be discarded. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Compatibility and Stability Valproate sodium injection was found to be physically compatible and chemically stable in the following parenteral solutions for at least 24 hours when stored in glass or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). • dextrose (5%) injection, USP • sodium chloride (0.9%) injection, USP • lactated ringer's injection, USP 2.3 Dosing in Patients Taking Rufinamide Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] .","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Valproate sodium injection is indicated as an intravenous alternative in patients in whom oral administration of valproate products is temporarily not feasible in the following conditions: • Monotherapy and adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures and simple and complex absence seizures; adjunctive therapy in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures ( 1 ) 1.1 Epilepsy Valproate sodium injection is indicated as an intravenous alternative in patients for whom oral administration of valproate products is temporarily not feasible in the following conditions: Valproate sodium injection is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Valproate sodium injection is also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures. Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present. See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) for statement regarding fatal hepatic dysfunction. 1.2 Important Limitations Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations, which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . For prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications ( 4 )] .","10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with valproate may result in somnolence, heart block, deep coma, and hypernatremia. Fatalities have been reported; however patients have recovered from valproate serum concentrations as high as 2,120 mcg/mL. In overdose situations, the fraction of drug not bound to protein is high and hemodialysis or tandem hemodialysis plus hemoperfusion may result in significant removal of drug. General supportive measures should be applied with particular attention to the maintenance of adequate urinary output. Naloxone has been reported to reverse the CNS depressant effects of valproate overdosage. Because naloxone could theoretically also reverse the antiepileptic effects of valproate, it should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy.","Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC",VALPROATE SODIUM
VENLAFAXINE,N/A,N/A,Seizure,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial Treatment The recommended starting dose for venlafaxine tablets is 75 mg/day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food. Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg/day. If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225 mg/day. When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses (see PRECAUTIONS , General , Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness) . Special Populations Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester Neonates exposed to venlafaxine tablets, other SNRIs, or SSRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS ). When treating pregnant women with venlafaxine tablets during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. Dosage for Patients with Hepatic Impairment Given the decrease in clearance and increase in elimination half-life for both venlafaxine and ODV that is observed in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and mild and moderate hepatic impairment compared to normal subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ), it is recommended that the total daily dose be reduced by 50% in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Since there was much individual variability in clearance between subjects with cirrhosis, it may be necessary to reduce the dose even more than 50%, and individualization of dosing may be desirable in some patients. Dosage for Patients with Renal Impairment Given the decrease in clearance for venlafaxine and the increase in elimination half-life for both venlafaxine and ODV that is observed in patients with renal impairment (GFR = 10 to 70 mL/min) compared to normals (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ), it is recommended that the total daily dose be reduced by 25% in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. It is recommended that the total daily dose be reduced by 50% in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Since there was much individual variability in clearance between patients with renal impairment, individualization of dosing may be desirable in some patients. Dosage for Elderly Patients No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients on the basis of age. As with any antidepressant, however, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly. When individualizing the dosage, extra care should be taken when increasing the dose. Maintenance Treatment It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode. In one study, in which patients responding during 8 weeks of acute treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules (75, 150, or 225 mg/day, qAM) during 26 weeks of maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, longer-term efficacy was demonstrated. A second longer-term study has demonstrated the efficacy of venlafaxine tablets in maintaining an antidepressant response in patients with recurrent depression who had responded and continued to be improved during an initial 26 weeks of treatment and were then randomly assigned to placebo or venlafaxine tablets for periods of up to 52 weeks on the same dose (100 to 200 mg/day, on a b.i.d. schedule) (see CLINICAL TRIALS ). Based on these limited data, it is not known whether or not the dose of venlafaxine tablets/venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment. Discontinuing Venlafaxine Tablets Symptoms associated with discontinuation of venlafaxine tablets, other SNRIs, and SSRIs, have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with venlafaxine tablets. Conversely, at least 7 days should be allowed after stopping venlafaxine tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Use of Venlafaxine Tablets With Other MAOls, Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue Do not start venlafaxine tablets in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In some cases, a patient already receiving therapy with venlafaxine tablets may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, venlafaxine tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 7 days or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with venlafaxine tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see WARNINGS ). The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with venlafaxine tablets is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use (see WARNINGS ).","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Venlafaxine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The efficacy of venlafaxine tablets, USP in the treatment of major depressive disorder was established in 6 week controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III or DSM-III-R category of major depression and in a 4 week controlled trial of inpatients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression with melancholia (see CLINICAL TRIALS ). A major depressive episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 26 weeks following 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. The efficacy of venlafaxine tablets in maintaining an antidepressant response in patients with recurrent depression who had responded and continued to be improved during an initial 26 weeks of treatment and were then followed for a period of up to 52 weeks was demonstrated in a second placebo-controlled trial (see CLINICAL TRIALS ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use venlafaxine tablets/venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.","OVERDOSAGE Human Experience There were 14 reports of acute overdose with venlafaxine tablets, either alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, among the patients included in the premarketing evaluation. The majority of the reports involved ingestions in which the total dose of venlafaxine tablets taken was estimated to be no more than several-fold higher than the usual therapeutic dose. The 3 patients who took the highest doses were estimated to have ingested approximately 6.75 g, 2.75 g, and 2.5 g. The resultant peak plasma levels of venlafaxine for the latter 2 patients were 6.24 and 2.35 mcg/mL, respectively, and the peak plasma levels of O-desmethylvenlafaxine were 3.37 and 1.30 mcg/mL, respectively. Plasma venlafaxine levels were not obtained for the patient who ingested 6.75 g of venlafaxine. All 14 patients recovered without sequelae. Most patients reported no symptoms. Among the remaining patients, somnolence was the most commonly reported symptom. The patient who ingested 2.75 g of venlafaxine was observed to have 2 generalized convulsions and a prolongation of QTc to 500 msec, compared with 405 msec at baseline. Mild sinus tachycardia was reported in 2 of the other patients. In postmarketing experience, overdose with venlafaxine has occurred predominantly in combination with alcohol and/or other drugs. The most commonly reported events in overdosage include tachycardia, changes in level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma), mydriasis, seizures, and vomiting. Electrocardiogram changes (e.g., prolongation of QT interval, bundle branch block, QRS prolongation), ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, vertigo, liver necrosis, serotonin syndrome, and death have been reported. Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcomes compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products, but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants. Epidemiological studies have shown that venlafaxine-treated patients have a higher preexisting burden of suicide risk factors than SSRI-treated patients. The extent to which the finding of an increased risk of fatal outcomes can be attributed to the toxicity of venlafaxine in overdosage as opposed to some characteristic(s) of venlafaxine-treated patients is not clear. Prescriptions for venlafaxine tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Management of Overdosage Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for venlafaxine are known. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR).","NuCare Pharmaceuticals,Inc.",VENLAFAXINE

A patient may self-inject HUMIRA or a caregiver may inject HUMIRA using either the HUMIRA Pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. HUMIRA can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the HUMIRA Pen, prefilled syringe, or single-dose institutional use vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. HUMIRA does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. NOTE: Instruct patients sensitive to latex not to handle the needle cover of the HUMIRA 40 mg/0.8 mL Pen and 40 mg/0.8 mL, 20 mg/0.4 mL and 10 mg/0.2 mL prefilled syringe because it may contain natural rubber latex [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 ) ] . Instruct patients using the HUMIRA Pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ] . Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. The HUMIRA single-dose institutional use vial is for administration within an institutional setting only, such as a hospital, physician’s office or clinic. Withdraw the dose using a sterile needle and syringe and administer promptly by a healthcare provider within an institutional setting. Only administer one dose per vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE HUMIRA is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker indicated for: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) ( 1.1 ): reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA.

Complete all age-appropriate vaccinations as recommended by current immunization guidelines prior to initiating treatment with Enbrel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. 2.2 Important Administration Instructions Administration of one 50 mg Enbrel single - dose prefilled syringe, one single - dose prefilled Enbrel SureClick autoinjector, or one Enbrel Mini single - dose prefilled cartridge (for use with the AutoTouch reusable autoinjector only), provides a dose equivalent to two 25 mg Enbrel single-dose prefilled syringes, two 25 mg single - dose vials, or two multiple-dose vials of lyophilized Enbrel, when multiple - dose vials are reconstituted and administered as recommended. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Plaque Psoriasis Enbrel is administered by subcutaneous injection (Table 1). Table 1. Recommended Dosage for Adult Patients with RA, AS, PsA and PsO Patient Population Recommended Dosage Adult RA, AS, and PsA 50 mg weekly Adult PsO Starting Dose : 50 mg twice weekly for 3 months Maintenance Dose : 50 mg once weekly See the Enbrel (etanercept) ""Instructions for Use"" insert for detailed information on injection site selection and dose administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Adult Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, and Psoriatic Arthritis Patients Methotrexate, glucocorticoids, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or analgesics may be continued during treatment with Enbrel. Based on a study of 50 mg Enbrel twice weekly in patients with RA that suggested higher incidence of adverse reactions but similar American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates, doses higher than 50 mg per week are not recommended. Adult Plaque Psoriasis Patients In addition to the 50 mg twice weekly recommended starting dose, starting doses of 25 mg or 50 mg per week were shown to be efficacious. The proportion of responders was related to Enbrel dosage [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients with Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Plaque Psoriasis, and Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis The recommended weight-based dosage for pediatric patients is administered by subcutaneous injection (Table 2). Table 2. Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients with pJIA, PsO and JPsA Body Weight Recommended Dosage 63 kg (138 pounds) or more 50 mg weekly Less than 63 kg (138 pounds) 0.8 mg/kg weekly To achieve pediatric doses other than 25 mg or 50 mg, use Enbrel solution in a single-dose vial or reconstituted lyophilized powder in a multiple-dose vial. Dosages of Enbrel higher than those described in Table 2 have not been studied in pediatric patients. In pJIA patients, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, or analgesics may be continued during treatment with Enbrel. 2.5 Preparation Instructions for Enbrel Enbrel is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician. Patients may self-inject when deemed appropriate and if they receive medical follow-up, as necessary. Patients should not self-administer until they receive proper training in how to prepare and administer the correct dose. Administer injections subcutaneously in the thigh, abdomen or outer area of the upper arm. The Enbrel devices are not made with natural rubber latex. The Enbrel (etanercept) ""Instructions for Use"" insert for each presentation contains more detailed instructions on injection site selection and the preparation of Enbrel. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Prefilled Syringe For a more comfortable injection, leave Enbrel prefilled syringes at room temperature for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the needle cover while allowing the prefilled syringe to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. When using the Enbrel single-dose prefilled syringe, check to see if the amount of liquid in the prefilled syringe falls between the two purple fill level indicator lines on the syringe. If the syringe does not have the right amount of liquid, DO NOT USE THAT SYRINGE. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Prefilled SureClick Autoinjector Leave the autoinjector at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the needle cover while allowing the prefilled syringe to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Vial For a more comfortable injection, leave Enbrel vial(s) at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the vial cap while allowing the vial to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. When using the Enbrel single-dose vial, administer the correct dose of solution using the following recommended materials: A 1 mL Luer-Lock syringe. A withdrawal needle with Luer-Lock connection, sterile, 22-gauge, length 1 ½ inch. An injection needle with Luer-Lock connection, sterile, 27-gauge, length ½ inch. Two vials may be required to administer the total prescribed dose. Use the same syringe for each vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions. Preparation of Enbrel Lyophilized Powder in a Multiple-dose Vial Enbrel lyophilized powder should be reconstituted aseptically with 1 mL of the supplied Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol), giving a solution of 1 mL containing 25 mg of Enbrel. A vial adapter is supplied for use when reconstituting the lyophilized powder. However, the vial adapter should not be used if multiple doses are going to be withdrawn from the vial. If the vial will be used for multiple doses, a 25-gauge needle should be used for reconstituting and withdrawing Enbrel, and the supplied ""Mixing Date:"" sticker should be attached to the vial and the date of reconstitution entered. Reconstituted solution must be refrigerated at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C) and used within 14 days. Discard reconstituted solution after 14 days because product stability and sterility cannot be assured after 14 days. DO NOT store reconstituted Enbrel solution at room temperature. For a more comfortable injection, leave the Enbrel dose tray at room temperature for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting. If using the vial adapter, twist the vial adapter onto the diluent syringe. Then, place the vial adapter over the Enbrel vial and insert the vial adapter into the vial stopper. Push down on the plunger to inject the diluent into the Enbrel vial. If using a 25-gauge needle to reconstitute and withdraw Enbrel, the diluent should be injected very slowly into the Enbrel vial. It is normal for some foaming to occur. Keeping the diluent syringe in place, gently swirl the contents of the Enbrel vial during dissolution. To avoid excessive foaming, do not shake or vigorously agitate. Generally, dissolution of Enbrel takes less than 10 minutes. Do not use the solution if discolored or cloudy, or if particulate matter remains. Withdraw the correct dose of reconstituted solution into the syringe. Some foam or bubbles may remain in the vial. Remove the syringe from the vial adapter or remove the 25-gauge needle from the syringe. Attach a 27-gauge needle to inject Enbrel. The contents of one vial of Enbrel solution should not be mixed with, or transferred into, the contents of another vial of Enbrel. No other medications should be added to solutions containing Enbrel, and do not reconstitute Enbrel with other diluents. Do not filter reconstituted solution during preparation or administration. Preparation of Enbrel Mini ® single-dose prefilled cartridge using the AutoTouch ® reusable autoinjector Leave Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the purple cap while allowing the cartridge to reach room temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. To use AutoTouch reusable autoinjector, open the door by pushing the door button and inserting Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge into AutoTouch.

IMATINIB MESYLATE,77,801,Malignant melanoma of sites other than skin,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment. As with all antipsychotic drugs, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control. To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient’s age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Children, debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels, as recommended below. Clinical experience suggests the following recommendations: Oral Administration Inital Dosage Range Adults Moderate Symptomatology - 0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Severe Symptomatology - 3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. To achieve prompt control, higher doses may be required in some cases. Geriatric or Debilitated Patients - 0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Chronic or Resistant Patients - 3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Patients who remain severely disturbed or inadequately controlled may require dosage adjustment. Daily dosages up to 100 mg may be necessary in some cases to achieve an optimal response. Infrequently haloperidol has been used in doses above 100 mg for severely resistant patients; however the limited clinical usage has not demonstrated the safety of prolonged administration of such doses. Children The following recommendations apply to children between the ages of 3 and 12 years (weight range 15 kg to 40 kg). Haloperidol is not intended for children under 3 years old. Therapy should begin at the lowest dose possible (0.5 mg per day). If required, the dose should be increased by an increment of 0.5 mg at 5 to 7 day intervals until the desired therapeutic effect is obtained. (See chart below.) The total dose may be divided, to be given b.i.d. or t.i.d. Psychotic Disorders - 0.05 mg/kg/day to 0.15 mg/kg/day Nonpsychotic Behavior Disorders and Tourette's Disorder - 0.05 mg/kg/day to 0.075 mg/kg/day Severely disturbed psychotic children may require higher doses. In severely disturbed, non-psychotic children or in hyperactive children with accompanying conduct disorders, who have failed to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics, it should be noted that since these behaviors may be short lived, short term administration of haloperidol may suffice. There is no evidence establishing a maximum effective dosage. There is little evidence that behavior improvement is further enhanced in dosages beyond 6 mg per day. Maintenance Dosage Upon achieving a satisfactory therapeutic response, dosage should then be gradually reduced to the lowest effective maintenance level. Switchover Procedure The oral form should supplant the injectable as soon as practicable. In the absence of bioavailability studies establishing bioequivalence between these two dosage forms the following guidelines for dosage are suggested. For an initial approximation of the total daily dose required, the parenteral dose administered in the preceding 24 hours may be used. Since this dose is only an initial estimate, it is recommended that careful monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, including clinical efficacy, sedation, and adverse effects, be carried out periodically for the first several days following the initiation of switchover. In this way, dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, can be quickly accomplished. Depending on the patient’s clinical status, the first oral dose should be given within 12 to 24 hours following the last parenteral dose.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Haloperidol is indicated for use in the management of manifestations of psychotic disorders. Haloperidol is indicated for the control of tics and vocal utterances of Tourette’s Disorder in children and adults. Haloperidol is effective for the treatment of severe behavior problems in children of combative, explosive hyperexcitability (which cannot be accounted for by immediate provocation). Haloperidol is also effective in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics.","OVERDOSAGE Manifestations In general, the symptoms of overdosage would be an exaggeration of known pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most prominent of which would be: 1) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 2) hypotension, or 3) sedation. The patient would appear comatose with respiratory depression and hypotension which could be severe enough to produce a shock-like state. The extrapyramidal reaction would be manifest by muscular weakness or rigidity and a generalized or localized tremor as demonstrated by the akinetic or agitans types respectively. With accidental overdosage, hypertension rather than hypotension occurred in a 2 year old child. The risk of ECG changes associated with Torsades de pointes should be considered. (For further information regarding Torsades de pointes, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Treatment Gastric lavage or induction of emesis should be carried out immediately followed by administration of activated charcoal. Since there is no specific antidote, treatment is primarily supportive. A patent airway must be established by use of an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube or, in prolonged cases of coma, by tracheostomy. Respiratory depression may be counteracted by artificial respiration and mechanical respirators. Hypotension and circulatory collapse may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine should not be used. In case of seere extrapyramidal reactions, antiarkinson medication should be administered. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for signs of Q-T prolongation or dysrhythmias and monitoring should continue until the ECG is normal. Severe arrhythmias should be treated with appropriate anti-arrhythmic measures.",N/A,N/A

PREDNISONE,N/A,N/A,Respiratory tract infection bacterial,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT ® (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing’s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1¼ to 1½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1.

Miscellaneous Tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement","WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1.

Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

Tacrolimus extended-release capsules is not interchangeable or substitutable for tacrolimus extended-release tablets, tacrolimus immediate-release capsules or tacrolimus for oral suspension. Under or overexposure to tacrolimus may result in graft rejection or other serious adverse reactions. Changes between tacrolimus immediate-release and extended-release dosage forms must occur under physician supervision [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Advise patients to swallow tacrolimus extended-release capsules whole with liquid; patients must not chew, divide, or crush the capsules. Tacrolimus extended-release capsules should be taken consistently every morning at the same time to ensure consistent and maximum possible drug exposure, on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before a meal, or at least 2 hours after a meal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. If a dose is missed, the dose may be taken up to 14 hours after the scheduled time (i.e., for a missed 8:00 AM dose, a dose may be taken by 10:00 PM). Beyond the 14-hour time frame, the patient should wait until the usual scheduled time the following morning to take the next regular daily dose. Instruct the patient not to double the next dose. Advise patients to avoid eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice or alcoholic beverages while taking tacrolimus extended-release capsules [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. Therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended for all patients receiving tacrolimus extended-release capsules [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Kidney Transplant Patients Table 1 includes the recommended starting tacrolimus extended-release capsules dosages and whole blood trough concentration ranges; the observed trough concentrations are shown in another section of the Full Prescribing Information [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] .

However, due to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for African-American Patients, Patients with Hepatic Impairment, and Drug Interactions African-American patients, compared to Caucasian patients, may need to be titrated to higher tacrolimus extended-release capsules dosages to attain comparable trough concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh ≥ 10) may require a lower starting dosage of tacrolimus extended-release capsules, due to the reduced clearance and prolonged half-life [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Dose adjustments of tacrolimus extended-release capsules may be necessary when administered concomitantly with CYP3A inducers or CYP3A inhibitors or cannabidiol [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 , 5.15 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.3 )]. 2.4 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Measure tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations at least two times on separate days during the first week after initiation of dosing and after a change in dosage, after a change in co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers and/or inhibitors or cannabidiol [see Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.3 )] , or after a change in renal or hepatic function. When interpreting measured concentrations, consider that the time to achieve tacrolimus steady state is approximately 7 days after initiating or changing the tacrolimus extended-release capsules dose. Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations using a validated assay [e.g., immunoassays or high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC/MS/MS)]. The immunosuppressive activity of tacrolimus is mainly due to the parent drug rather than to its metabolites. Immunoassays may react with metabolites as well as the parent drug. Therefore, whole blood tacrolimus trough concentrations obtained with immunoassays may be numerically higher than concentrations obtained with an assay using HPLC/MS/MS. Comparison of the whole blood tacrolimus trough concentrations of patients to those described in the prescribing information and other published literature must be made with knowledge of the assay method(s) employed.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tacrolimus extended-release capsules is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients in combination with other immunosuppressants in adult patients who can swallow capsules intact [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ), ( 14.2 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Astellas Pharma US, Inc.'s ASTAGRAF XL (tacrolimus extended-release capsules). However, due to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.

( 1 , 14.1 , 14.2 )","10 OVERDOSAGE Postmarketing cases of overdose with tacrolimus have been reported. Overdosage adverse reactions included: nervous system disorders (tremor, headache, confusional state, balance disorders, encephalopathy, lethargy and somnolence) gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) abnormal renal function (increased blood urea nitrogen and elevated serum creatinine) urticaria hypertension peripheral edema, and infections [one fatal postmarketing case of bilateral pneumopathy and CMV infection was attributed to tacrolimus (extended-release) overdose]. Based on the poor aqueous solubility and extensive erythrocyte and plasma protein binding, it is anticipated that tacrolimus is not dialyzable to any significant extent; there is no experience with charcoal hemoperfusion. The oral use of activated charcoal has been reported in treating acute overdoses, but experience has not been sufficient to warrant recommending its use. General supportive measures and treatment of specific symptoms should be followed in all cases of overdosage.","Chengdu Suncadia Medicine Co., Ltd.",TACROLIMUS EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES
PREDNISONE,N/A,N/A,Premature baby,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT ® (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing’s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1¼ to 1½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1.

More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1. Endocrine Disorders Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (hydrocortisone or cortisone is the first choice; synthetic analogs may be used in conjunction with mineralocorticoids where applicable; in infancy mineralocorticoid supplementation is of particular importance) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hypercalcemia associated with cancer Nonsuppurative thyroiditis 2. Rheumatic Disorders As adjunctive therapy for short-term administration (to tide the patient over an acute episode or exacerbation) in: Psoriatic arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (selected cases may require low-dose maintenance therapy) Ankylosing spondylitis Acute and subacute bursitis Acute nonspecific tenosynovitis Acute gouty arthritis Post-traumatic osteoarthritis Synovitis of osteoarthritis Epicondylitis 3.

Edematous States To induce a diuresis or remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome, without uremia, of the idiopathic type or that due to lupus erythematosus. 11. Gastrointestinal Diseases To tide the patient over a critical period of the disease in: Ulcerative colitis Regional enteritis 12. Nervous System Acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis 13. Miscellaneous Tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement","WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

The daily dose is determined by individualized patient titration and composed of: A Morning Dose A Continuous Dose Extra Doses The maximum recommended daily dose of DUOPA is 2000 mg of the levodopa component (i.e., one cassette per day) administered over 16 hours. At the end of the daily 16-hour infusion, patients will disconnect the pump from the PEG-J and take their night-time dose of oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets. Treatment with DUOPA is initiated in 3 steps [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] : Conversion of patients to oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets in preparation for DUOPA treatment. Calculation and administration of the DUOPA starting dose (Morning Dose and Continuous Dose) for Day 1. Titration of the dose as needed based on individual clinical response and tolerability. Extra Doses DUOPA has an extra dose function that can be used to manage acute “Off” symptoms that are not controlled by the Morning Dose and the Continuous Dose administered over 16 hours. The extra dose function should be set at 1 mL (20 mg of levodopa) when starting DUOPA. If the amount of the extra dose needs to be adjusted, it is typically done in 0.2 mL increments. The extra dose frequency should be limited to one extra dose every 2 hours. Administration of frequent extra doses may cause or worsen dyskinesias. Once no further adjustments are required to the DUOPA Morning Dose, Continuous Dose, or Extra Dose, this dosing regimen should be administered daily. Over time, additional changes may be necessary based on the patient’s clinical response and tolerability. 2.2 Initiation and Titration Instructions Prepare for DUOPA Treatment Prior to initiating DUOPA, convert patients from all other forms of levodopa to oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets (1:4 ratio). Patients should remain on a stable dose of their concomitant medications taken for the treatment of Parkinson's disease before initiation of DUOPA infusion. Healthcare providers should ensure patients take their oral Parkinson's disease medications the morning of the PEG-J procedure. Determine the DUOPA Starting Dose for Day 1 The steps for determining the initial DUOPA daily dosing (Morning Dose and Continuous Dose) for Day 1 are outlined below. Step 1: Calculate and administer the DUOPA Morning Dose for Day 1 a. Determine the total amount of levodopa (in milligrams) in the first dose of oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa that was taken by the patient on the previous day. b. Convert the oral levodopa dose from milligrams to milliliters by multiplying the oral dose by 0.8 and dividing by 20 mg/mL. This calculation will provide the Morning Dose of DUOPA in milliliters. c. Add 3 milliliters to the Morning Dose to fill (prime) the intestinal tube to obtain the Total Morning Dose. d. The Total Morning Dose is usually administered over 10 to 30 minutes. e. Program the pump to deliver the Total Morning Dose. Step 2: Calculate and administer the DUOPA Continuous Dose for Day 1 a. Determine the amount of oral immediate-release levodopa that the patient received from oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa doses throughout the previous day (16 waking hours), in milligrams. Do not include the doses of oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa taken at night when calculating the levodopa amount. b. Subtract the first oral levodopa dose in milligrams taken by the patient on the previous day (determined in Step 1 (a)) from the total oral levodopa dose in milligrams taken over 16 waking hours (determined in Step 2 (a)). Divide the result by 20 mg/mL. This is the dose of DUOPA administered as a Continuous Dose (in mL) over 16 hours. c. The hourly infusion rate (mL per hour) is obtained by dividing the Continuous Dose by 16 (hours). This value will be programmed into the pump as the continuous rate. d. If persistent or numerous “Off” periods occur during the 16-hour infusion, consider increasing the Continuous Dose or using the Extra Dose function. If dyskinesia or DUOPA-related adverse reactions occur, consider decreasing the Continuous Dose or stopping the infusion until the adverse reactions subside. DUOPA Titration The daily dose of DUOPA can be titrated as needed, based on the patient’s individual clinical response and tolerability after Day 1 of DUOPA treatment and until a stable daily dose is maintained. Adjustments to concomitant Parkinson’s disease medications may be needed. In the controlled trial, the average number of titration days required to establish a stable Morning and Continuous Dose was 5 days. Additional dose adjustments may be necessary over time based on the patient level of activity and disease progression. The recommendations for adjusting the DUOPA Morning and Continuous Doses are provided below. Morning Dose Adjustment If there was an inadequate clinical response within 1 hour of the Morning Dose on the preceding day, adjust the Morning Dose (excluding the 3 mL to fill the tube) as follows: If the Morning Dose on the preceding day was less than or equal to 6 mL, increase the Morning Dose by 1 mL. If the Morning Dose on the preceding day was greater than 6 mL, increase the Morning Dose by 2 mL. If the patient experienced dyskinesias or DUOPA-related adverse reactions within 1 hour of the Morning Dose on the preceding day, decrease the Morning Dose by 1 mL. Continuous Dose Adjustment Consider increasing the Continuous Dose based on the number and volume of Extra Doses of DUOPA (i.e., total amount of levodopa component) that were needed for the previous day and the patient’s clinical response. Consider decreasing the Continuous Dose if the patient experienced troublesome dyskinesia, or other troublesome DUOPA-related adverse reactions on the preceding day: For troublesome adverse reactions lasting for a period of one hour or more, decrease the Continuous Dose by 0.3 mL per hour. For troublesome adverse reactions lasting for two or more periods of one hour or more, decrease the Continuous Dose by 0.6 mL per hour. 2.3 Administration Information DUOPA should be used at room temperature. Take one DUOPA cassette out of the refrigerator and out of the carton 20 minutes prior to use; failure to use the product at room temperature may result in the patient not receiving the right amount of medication. DUOPA is delivered as a 16-hour infusion through either a naso-jejunal tube for short-term administration or through a PEG-J for long-term administration. The cassettes are for single-use only and should not be used for longer than 16 hours, even if some drug product remains. An opened cassette should not be re-used. The PEG-J should be disconnected from the pump at the end of the daily 16-hour administration period and flushed with room temperature potable water with a syringe. Long-term administration of DUOPA requires placement of a PEG-J outer transabdominal tube and inner jejunal tube by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. DUOPA is dispensed from medication cassette reservoirs that are specifically designed to be connected to the CADD ® -Legacy 1400 pump. Establishment of the transabdominal port should be performed by a gastroenterologist or other healthcare provider experienced in this procedure. See Table 1 for the recommended tubing sets for PEG-J administration. For short-term, temporary administration of DUOPA prior to PEG-J tube placement, treatment may be initiated by a naso-jejunal tube with observation of the patient’s clinical response. See Table 2 for the recommended tubing sets for naso-jejunal administration. Table 1.

DUOPA,77,801,Chest pain,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The maximum recommended daily dose of DUOPA is 2000 mg of levodopa (i.e., one cassette per day) administered over 16 hours ( 2.1 ) Prior to initiating DUOPA, convert patients from all forms of levodopa to oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets (1:4 ratio) ( 2.2 ) Titrate total daily dose based on clinical response for the patient ( 2.2 ) Administer DUOPA into the jejunum through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal tube (PEG-J) with the CADD®-Legacy 1400 portable infusion pump ( 2.3 ) 2.1 DUOPA Daily Dose DUOPA is administered over a 16-hour infusion period. The daily dose is determined by individualized patient titration and composed of: A Morning Dose A Continuous Dose Extra Doses The maximum recommended daily dose of DUOPA is 2000 mg of the levodopa component (i.e., one cassette per day) administered over 16 hours. At the end of the daily 16-hour infusion, patients will disconnect the pump from the PEG-J and take their night-time dose of oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets. Treatment with DUOPA is initiated in 3 steps [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] : Conversion of patients to oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets in preparation for DUOPA treatment. Calculation and administration of the DUOPA starting dose (Morning Dose and Continuous Dose) for Day 1. Titration of the dose as needed based on individual clinical response and tolerability. Extra Doses DUOPA has an extra dose function that can be used to manage acute “Off” symptoms that are not controlled by the Morning Dose and the Continuous Dose administered over 16 hours. The extra dose function should be set at 1 mL (20 mg of levodopa) when starting DUOPA. If the amount of the extra dose needs to be adjusted, it is typically done in 0.2 mL increments. The extra dose frequency should be limited to one extra dose every 2 hours. Administration of frequent extra doses may cause or worsen dyskinesias. Once no further adjustments are required to the DUOPA Morning Dose, Continuous Dose, or Extra Dose, this dosing regimen should be administered daily. Over time, additional changes may be necessary based on the patient’s clinical response and tolerability. 2.2 Initiation and Titration Instructions Prepare for DUOPA Treatment Prior to initiating DUOPA, convert patients from all other forms of levodopa to oral immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa tablets (1:4 ratio). Patients should remain on a stable dose of their concomitant medications taken for the treatment of Parkinson's disease before initiation of DUOPA infusion.

LYRICA,77,801,Chest pain,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • LYRICA CR should be administered once daily after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed, or chewed. ( 2.1 ) • Dosing recommendations for LYRICA CR: Indication Dosing Regimen Initial Dose Maximum Dose DPN Pain ( 2.2 ) Single dose per day 165 mg/day 330 mg/day within 1 week. PHN ( 2.3 ) Single dose per day 165 mg/day 330 mg/day within 1 week. Maximum dose of 660 mg/day. • Conversion from LYRICA Capsules or Oral Solution to LYRICA CR: See full prescribing information. ( 2.4 ) • Dose modification recommended in patients with renal impairment. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions LYRICA CR should be administered once daily after an evening meal. LYRICA CR should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed, or chewed. When discontinuing LYRICA CR, taper gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Instruct patients that if they miss taking their dose of LYRICA CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of LYRICA CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of LYRICA CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of LYRICA CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of LYRICA CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of LYRICA CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 2.2 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Begin dosing at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of LYRICA CR is 330 mg once daily. Although LYRICA was studied at 600 mg/day, there was no evidence that this dose conferred additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions with LYRICA, treatment with doses above 330 mg/day is not recommended for LYRICA CR. 2.3 Postherpetic Neuralgia Begin dosing at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate LYRICA CR, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of LYRICA CR is 660 mg once daily. 2.4 Conversion from LYRICA Capsules or Oral Solution to LYRICA CR When switching from LYRICA to LYRICA CR on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of LYRICA as prescribed and initiate LYRICA CR therapy after an evening meal. Table 1.

Those patients should receive LYRICA. In view of dose-dependent adverse reactions and because pregabalin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in patients with reduced renal function. Base the dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment on CLcr, as indicated in Table 2. To use the dosing tables, an estimate of the patient's CLcr in mL/min is needed. CLcr in mL/min may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the Cockcroft and Gault equation: Next, refer to the Dosage and Administration section to determine the recommended total daily dose based on indication, for a patient with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min). Then refer to Table 2 to determine the corresponding renal adjusted dose. (For example: A patient initiating LYRICA CR therapy for postherpetic neuralgia with normal renal function [CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min], receives a single daily dose of 165 mg/day pregabalin. Therefore, a renal impaired patient with a CLcr of 50 mL/min would receive a single daily dose of 82.5 mg.) Table 2.

Seizures and heart block have also been reported. Deaths have been reported in the setting of lone LYRICA overdose and in combination with other CNS depressants. Treatment or Management of Overdose There is no specific antidote for overdose with pregabalin. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; observe usual precautions to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for up-to-date information on the management of overdose with pregabalin. Pregabalin can be removed by hemodialysis. Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of pregabalin (approximately 50% in 4 hours).",Parke-Davis Div of Pfizer Inc,PREGABALIN
TRAMADOL,77,801,Chest pain,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. (2.1) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. (2.1, 5) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (5.1) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. (2.1, 5.2) Do not exceed a daily dose of 300 mg tramadol. Do not use with other tramadol products. (2.1) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient’s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose (2.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3). For opioid-naïve and opioid non-tolerant patients, initiate tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets at a dose of 100 mg once daily, then titrate up by 100 mg increments every 5 days according to need and tolerance. (2.3) For patients currently on tramadol IR, calculate total 24-hr IR dose, and initiate tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets at a dose rounded down to next lower 100 mg increment; then adjust dose according to need and tolerance. See full prescribing information for instructions on conversion, titration, and maintenance of therapy. (2.3, 2.4) Do not abruptly discontinue tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically-dependent patient. (2.5) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Do not use tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets concomitantly with other tramadol products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), (5.15)]. Do not administer tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] . Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] . Instruct patients to swallow tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole [see Patient Counseling Information (17)], and to take it with liquid. Crushing, chewing, splitting, or dissolving tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of tramadol and can lead to overdose or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be taken without regard to food, It is recommended that tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets be taken in a consistent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)]. Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Initial Dosage Patients Not Currently on a Tramadol Product The initial dose of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablet is 100 mg once daily. Patients Currently on Tramadol Immediate-Release (IR) Products Calculate the 24-hour tramadol IR dose and initiate a total daily dose of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets rounded down to the next lower 100 mg increment. The dose may subsequently be individualized according to patient need. Due to limitations in flexibility of dose selection with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets, some patients maintained on tramadol IR products may not be able to convert to tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Conversion from Other Opioids to Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets When tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate. 2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets by 100 mg every five days to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. The maximum daily dose of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets is 300 mg per day. Continually reevaluate patients receiving tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.18)] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] . Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.5 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Do not abruptly discontinue tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ].","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets are indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosages or duration, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] , reserve tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic. Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an opioid agonist indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. (1) Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosages or duration, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations, reserve tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. (1) Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic. (1)","10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdosage with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, QT prolongation, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to tramadol overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. While naloxone will reverse some, but not all, symptoms caused by overdosage with tramadol, the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration. In animals, convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets could be suppressed with barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone. Naloxone administration did not change the lethality of an overdose in mice. Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful in an overdose because it removes less than 7% of the administered dose in a 4-hour dialysis period. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of tramadol in tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets will continue to release tramadol and add to the tramadol load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.","Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc.",TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE

CLONAZEPAM,77,801,Chest pain,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Clonazepam is available as a tablet. The tablets should be administered with water by swallowing the tablet whole. Seizure Disorders: The use of multiple anticonvulsants may result in an increase of CNS depressant adverse effects. This should be considered before adding clonazepam tablets to an existing anticonvulsant regimen. Adults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg. Pediatric Patients: Clonazepam tablets are administered orally. In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses. Dosage should be increased by no more than 0.25 to 0.5 mg every third day until a daily maintenance dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg of body weight has been reached, unless seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increase. Whenever possible, the daily dose should be divided into three equal doses. If doses are not equally divided, the largest dose should be given before retiring. Geriatric Patients: There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam tablets in seizure disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam tablets and observed closely (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ) . Panic Disorder: Adults: The initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg twice daily. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose and were associated with more adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0.25 mg bid every 3 days until panic disorder is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable. Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg twice daily every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn. There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the physician who elects to use clonazepam tablets for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Pediatric Patients: There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam tablets in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age. Geriatric Patients: There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam tablets in panic disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam and observed closely (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of clonazepam tablets: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, increased seizure frequency, and status epilepticus, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) .","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Seizure Disorders: Clonazepam tablets are useful alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic and myoclonic seizures. In patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides, clonazepam tablets may be useful. Some loss of effect may occur during the course of clonazepam treatment (see PRECAUTIONS: Loss of Effect ). Panic Disorder: Clonazepam tablets are indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-V. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. The efficacy of clonazepam tablets was established in two 6- to 9-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials ). Panic disorder (DSM-V) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes. The effectiveness of clonazepam tablets in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use clonazepam tablets for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long- term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).","OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal (see WARNINGS: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction ). Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage. In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway maintenance. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.

(2.1) Administer at least 4 hours before or after drugs that are known to interfere with absorption. (2.1) Evaluate the need for dose adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect absorption. (2.1) Starting dose depends on a variety of factors, including age, body weight, cardiovascular status, and concomitant medications. Peak therapeutic effect may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks. (2.2) See full prescribing information for dosing in specific patient populations. (2.3) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and/or T4 as well as clinical status. (2.4) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets as a single daily dose, on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast with a full glass of water to avoid choking or gagging [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets at least 4 hours before or after drugs known to interfere with levothyroxine sodium absorption [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Evaluate the need for dosage adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect levothyroxine sodium tablets absorption [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 and 2.3) , Drug Interactions (7.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Administer levothyroxine sodium tablets to pediatric patients who cannot swallow intact tablets by crushing the tablet, suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5 to 10 mL) of water and immediately administering the suspension by spoon or dropper. Ensure the patient ingests the full amount of the suspension. Do not store the suspension. Do not administer in foods that decrease absorption of levothyroxine sodium tablets, such as soybean-based infant formula [see Drug Interactions (7.9) ]. 2.2 Important Considerations for Dosing The dosage of levothyroxine sodium tablets for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dosage adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. For adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is not a reliable measure of levothyroxine sodium dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate levothyroxine sodium tablets dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of levothyroxine sodium tablets may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Titration Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults The recommended starting daily dosage of levothyroxine sodium tablets in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Table 1. Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Adults* *Dosages greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily dosages greater than 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Patient Population Starting Dosage Dosage Titration Based on serum TSH or Free-T4 Adults diagnosed with hypothyroidism Full replacement dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day. Some patients require a lower starting dose. Titrate dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Adults at risk for atrial fibrillation or with underlying cardiac disease Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) Titrate dosage every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Geriatric patients Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients The recommended starting daily dosage of levothyroxine sodium tablets in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Table 2.

Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached. Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. The recommended daily dosage of levothyroxine sodium tablets in pregnant patients is described in Table 3. Table 3. Levothyroxine Sodium Tablet Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients Patient Population Starting Dosage Dose Adjustment and Titration Pre-existing primary hypothyroidism with serum TSH above normal trimester- specific range Pre-pregnancy dosage may increase during pregnancy Increase levothyroxine sodium dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Monitor TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. Reduce levothyroxine sodium dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery. Monitor serum TSH 4 to 8 weeks postpartum. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH ≥10 IU per liter) 1.6 mcg/kg/day Monitor serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust levothyroxine sodium dosage until serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH < 10 IU per liter) 1.0 mcg/kg/day TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Adult and Pediatric Patients The levothyroxine sodium dosage is based on the target level of TSH suppression for the stage and clinical status of thyroid cancer. 2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dosage. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dosage, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient’s clinical status. Pediatric Patients In patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in pediatric patients as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dosage stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. The general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level. TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of levothyroxine sodium therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per litre within 4 weeks may indicate the patient is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of levothyroxine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypothyroidism Levothyroxine sodium tablets are indicated in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates, as a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

( 2.2 ) Myocardial Infarction: The starting dosage depends upon tolerance of intravenous metoprolol, see full prescribing information. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Hypertension Individualize the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period. Larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. Measure blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day. 2.2 Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 2.3 Myocardial Infarction See prescribing information of intravenous metoprolol for dosage instructions for intravenous therapy. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose, initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose of metoprolol and continue for 48 hours. In the case of intolerance, reduce dose to 25 mg and administer for 48 hours. Titrate, based on tolerability, to a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol tartrate tablets beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metoprolol tartrate tablets are a beta-adrenergic blocker indicated for the treatment of: Hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1.1 ) Angina Pectoris. ( 1.2 ) Myocardial Infarction, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality when used in conjunction with intravenous metoprolol therapy in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction in hemodynamically stable patients. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Hypertension Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Metoprolol tartrate tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Angina Pectoris Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance. 1.3 Myocardial Infarction Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality when used alone or in conjunction with intravenous metoprolol.","10 OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms - Overdosage of metoprolol may lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. Clinical presentation can also include: atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness/coma, nausea and vomiting. Treatment – Consider treating the patient with intensive care. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability. Beta-blocker overdose may result in significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, employ the following measures. Hemodialysis is unlikely to make a useful contribution to metoprolol elimination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Bradycardia: Evaluate the need for atropine, adrenergic-stimulating drugs or pacemaker to treat bradycardia and conduction disorders. Hypotension: Treat underlying bradycardia. Consider intravenous vasopressor infusion, such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Heart failure and shock: May be treated when appropriate with suitable volume expansion, injection of glucagon (if necessary, followed by an intravenous infusion of glucagon), intravenous administration of adrenergic drugs such as dobutamine, with α 1 receptor agonistic drugs added in presence of vasodilation. Bronchospasm: Can usually be reversed by bronchodilators.","PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",METOPROLOL TARTRATE
AMANTADINE,77,801,Chest pain,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose of amantadine hydrochloride capsules may need reduction in patients with congestive heart failure, peripheral edema, orthostatic hypotension, or impaired renal function (see Dosage for Impaired Renal Function ).","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of signs and symptoms of infection caused by various strains of influenza A virus. Amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP are also indicated in the treatment of parkinsonism and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions. Influenza A Prophylaxis Amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for chemoprophylaxis against signs and symptoms of influenza A virus infection. Because amantadine does not completely prevent the host immune response to influenza A infection, individuals who take this drug may still develop immune responses to natural disease or vaccination and may be protected when later exposed to antigenically related viruses. Following vaccination during an influenza A outbreak, amantadine prophylaxis should be considered for the 2- to 4-week time period required to develop an antibody response. Influenza A Treatment Amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP are also indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated respiratory tract illness caused by influenza A virus strains especially when administered early in the course of illness. There are no well-controlled clinical studies demonstrating that treatment with amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP will avoid the development of influenza A virus pneumonitis or other complications in high risk patients. There is no clinical evidence indicating that amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP are effective in the prophylaxis or treatment of viral respiratory tract illnesses other than those caused by influenza A virus strains. The following points should be considered before initiating treatment or prophylaxis with amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP. • Amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP are not a substitute for early vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. • Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance mutations could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP. Parkinson’s Disease/Syndrome Amantadine hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated in the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (Paralysis Agitans), postencephalitic parkinsonism and symptomatic parkinsonism which may follow injury to the nervous system by carbon monoxide intoxication. It is indicated in those elderly patients believed to develop parkinsonism in association with cerebral arteriosclerosis. In the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, amantadine is less effective than levodopa, (-)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine, and its efficacy in comparison with the anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs has not yet been established. Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Reactions Amantadine hydrochloride, USP is indicated in the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions. Although anticholinergic-type side effects have been noted with amantadine when used in patients with drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions, there is a lower incidence of these side effects than that observed with the anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs.","OVERDOSAGE Deaths have been reported from overdose with amantadine. The lowest reported acute lethal dose was 1 gram. Because some patients have attempted suicide by overdosing with amantadine, prescriptions should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management. Acute toxicity may be attributable to the anticholinergic effects of amantadine. Drug overdose has resulted in cardiac, respiratory, renal or central nervous system toxicity. Cardiac dysfunction includes arrhythmia, tachycardia and hypertension. Pulmonary edema and respiratory distress (including adult respiratory distress syndrome – ARDS) have been reported; renal dysfunction including increased BUN, decreased creatinine clearance and renal insufficiency can occur. Central nervous system effects that have been reported include insomnia, anxiety, agitation, aggressive behavior, hypertonia, hyperkinesia, ataxia, gait abnormality, tremor, confusion, disorientation, depersonalization, fear, delirium, hallucinations, psychotic reactions, lethargy, somnolence and coma. Seizures may be exacerbated in patients with prior history of seizure disorders. Hyperthermia has also been observed in cases where a drug overdose has occurred. There is no specific antidote for an overdose of amantadine. However, slowly administered intravenous physostigmine in 1 and 2 mg doses in an adult 2 at 1- to 2-hour intervals and 0.5 mg doses in a child 3 at 5- to 10-minute intervals up to a maximum of 2 mg/hour have been reported to be effective in the control of central nervous system toxicity caused by amantadine hydrochloride. For acute overdosing, general supportive measures should be employed along with immediate gastric lavage or induction of emesis. Fluids should be forced, and if necessary, given intravenously. The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of amantadine. Since the excretion rate of amantadine increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body. The blood pressure, pulse, respiration and temperature should be monitored. The patient should be observed for hyperactivity and convulsions; if required, sedation, and anticonvulsant therapy should be administered. The patient should be observed for the possible development of arrhythmias and hypotension; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic and antihypotensive therapy should be given. Electrocardiographic monitoring may be required after ingestion, since malignant tachyarrhythmias can appear after overdose. Care should be exercised when administering adrenergic agents, such as isoproterenol, to patients with an amantadine overdose, since the dopaminergic activity of amantadine has been reported to induce malignant arrhythmias. The blood electrolytes, urine pH and urinary output should be monitored. If there is no record of recent voiding, catheterization should be done.",EPIC PHARMA LLC,AMANTADINE HYDROCHLORIDE

Infections of the ear, nose, throat, genitourinary tract, skin and skin structure, and lower respiratory tract. ( 1.1 – 1.4 ) In combination for treatment of H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease. ( 1.5 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.6 ) 1.1 Infections of the Ear, Nose, and Throat Amoxicillin is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY beta-lactamase–negative) isolates of Streptococcus species. (α- and β-hemolytic isolates only), Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus spp., or Haemophilus influenzae . 1.2 Infections of the Genitourinary Tract Amoxicillin is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY beta-lactamase–negative) isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis , or Enterococcus faecalis . 1.3 Infections of the Skin and Skin Structure Amoxicillin is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY beta-lactamase–negative) isolates of Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic isolates only), Staphylococcus spp., or E. coli . 1.4 Infections of the Lower Respiratory Tract Amoxicillin is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY beta-lactamase–negative) isolates of Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic isolates only), S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or H. influenzae . 1.5 Helicobacter pylori Infection Triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori with clarithromycin and lansoprazole Amoxicillin, in combination with clarithromycin plus lansoprazole as triple therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori . Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Dual therapy for H. pylori with lansoprazole Amoxicillin, in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected . (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. 1.6 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.","10 OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms. Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin 1 . Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria. Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin. Amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis.","Northwind Pharmaceuticals, LLC",AMOXICILLIN
ISOSORBIDE,77,801,Chest pain,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dose of isosorbide mononitrate extended-release tablets is 30 mg (given as a single 30 mg tablet or as 1/2 of a 60 mg tablet) or 60 mg (given as a single tablet) once daily. After several days, the dosage may be increased to 120 mg (given as a single 120 mg tablet or as two 60 mg tablets) once daily. Rarely, 240 mg may be required. The daily dose of isosorbide mononitrate extended-release tablets should be taken in the morning on arising. Isosorbide mononitrate extended-release tablets should not be chewed or crushed and should be swallowed together with a half-glassful of fluid.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Isosorbide mononitrate extended-release tablets, USP are indicated for the prevention of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. The onset of action of oral isosorbide mononitrate is not sufficiently rapid for this product to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode.","OVERDOSAGE Hemodynamic Effects The ill effects of isosorbide mononitrate overdose are generally the result of isosorbide mononitrate’s capacity to induce vasodilatation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo, palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures and death. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of isosorbide mononitrate and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of isosorbide mononitrate overdose. There are no data suggesting what dose of isosorbide mononitrate is likely to be life threatening in humans. In rats and mice, there is significant lethality at doses of 2000 mg/kg and 3000 mg/kg, respectively. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of isosorbide mononitrate. In particular, dialysis is known to be ineffective in removing isosorbide mononitrate from the body. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of isosorbide mononitrate is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of isosorbide mononitrate overdose. Because the hypotension associated with isosorbide mononitrate overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward an increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient’s legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good. In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of isosorbide mononitrate overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required. Methemoglobinemia Methemoglobinemia has been reported in patients receiving other organic nitrates, and it probably could also occur as a side effect of isosorbide mononitrate. Certainly nitrate ions liberated during metabolism of isosorbide mononitrate can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients totally without cytochrome b 5 reductase activity, however, and even assuming that the nitrate moiety of isosorbide mononitrate is quantitatively applied to oxidation of hemoglobin, about 2 mg/kg of isosorbide mononitrate should be required before any of these patients manifest clinically significant (≥10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of isosorbide mononitrate. In one study in which 36 patients received 2-4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr (equivalent, in total administered dose of nitrate ions, to 7.8 to 11.1 mg of isosorbide mononitrate per hour), the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%; this was comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received placebo. Notwithstanding these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia in association with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients had been thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO 2 . Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg intravenously.",Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited,ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE

The maximum recommended daily dose of ranolazine extended-release tablet is 1000 mg twice daily. If a dose of ranolazine extended-release tablet is missed, take the prescribed dose at the next scheduled time; do not double the next dose. 2.2 Dose Adjustments in Specific Populations Dose adjustments may be needed when ranolazine extended-release tablet is taken in combination with certain other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Limit the maximum dose of ranolazine extended-release tablet to 500 mg twice daily in patients on moderate CYP3A inhibitors such as diltiazem, verapamil, and erythromycin. Use of ranolazine extended-release tablet with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Use of P-gp inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, may increase exposure to ranolazine extended-release tablet. Titrate ranolazine extended-release tablet based on clinical response [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ].","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ranolazine extended-release tablet is indicated for the treatment of chronic angina. Ranolazine extended-release tablet may be used with beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, anti-platelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Ranolazine extended-release tablet is an antianginal indicated for the treatment of chronic angina.

SERTRALINE,77,801,Chest pain,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial Treatment Dosage for Adults Major Depressive Disorder –Sertraline hydrochloride treatment should be administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily. While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for major depressive disorder, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD or social anxiety disorder, patients were dosed in a range of 50-200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride for the treatment of this indication. Consequently, a dose of 50 mg, administered once daily, is recommended as the initial therapeutic dose. Patients not responding to a 50 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day. Given the 24 hour elimination half-life of sertraline hydrochloride, dose changes should not occur at intervals of less than 1 week. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride treatment should be initiated with a dose of 50 mg/day, either daily throughout the menstrual cycle or limited to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, depending on physician assessment. While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for PMDD, patients were dosed in the range of 50-150 mg/day with dose increases at the onset of each new menstrual cycle (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Patients not responding to a 50 mg/day dose may benefit from dose increases (at 50 mg increments/ menstrual cycle) up to 150 mg/day when dosing daily throughout the menstrual cycle, or 100 mg/day when dosing during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. If a 100 mg/day dose has been established with luteal phase dosing, a 50 mg/day titration step for three days should be utilized at the beginning of each luteal phase dosing period. Sertraline hydrochloride should be administered once daily, either in the morning or evening. Dosage for Pediatric Population (Children and Adolescents) Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride treatment should be initiated with a dose of 25 mg once daily in children (ages 6-12) and at a dose of 50 mg once daily in adolescents (ages 13-17). While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for OCD, patients were dosed in a range of 25-200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride for pediatric patients (6-17 years) with OCD. Patients not responding to an initial dose of 25 or 50 mg/day may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day. For children with OCD, their generally lower body weights compared to adults should be taken into consideration in advancing the dose, in order to avoid excess dosing. Given the 24 hour elimination half-life of Sertraline hydrochloride, dose changes should not occur at intervals of less than 1 week. Sertraline hydrochloride should be administered once daily, either in the morning or evening. Maintenance/Continuation/Extended Treatment Major Depressive Disorder –It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy beyond response to the acute episode. Systematic evaluation of sertraline hydrochloride has demonstrated that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of initial treatment at a dose of 50-200 mg/day (mean dose of 70 mg/day) (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). It is not known whether the dose of sertraline hydrochloride needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder –It is generally agreed that PTSD requires several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to initial treatment. Systematic evaluation of Sertraline hydrochloride has demonstrated that its efficacy in PTSD is maintained for periods of up to 28 weeks following 24 weeks of treatment at a dose of 50-200 mg/day (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). It is not known whether the dose of Sertraline hydrochloride needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Social Anxiety Disorder –Social anxiety disorder is a chronic condition that may require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to initial treatment. Systematic evaluation of Sertraline hydrochloride has demonstrated that its efficacy in social anxiety disorder is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of treatment at a dose of 50-200 mg/day (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain patients on the lowest effective dose and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for long-term treatment. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Panic Disorder –It is generally agreed that OCD and Panic Disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to initial treatment. Systematic evaluation of continuing Sertraline hydrochloride for periods of up to 28 weeks in patients with OCD and Panic Disorder who have responded while taking Sertraline hydrochloride during initial treatment phases of 24 to 52 weeks of treatment at a dose range of 50-200 mg/day has demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). It is not known whether the dose of Sertraline hydrochloride needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response. Nevertheless, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder –The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. However, as women commonly report that symptoms worsen with age until relieved by the onset of menopause, it is reasonable to consider continuation of a responding patient. Dosage adjustments, which may include changes between dosage regimens (e.g., daily throughout the menstrual cycle versus during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle), may be needed to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment. Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders: At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with Sertraline hydrochloride. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Sertraline hydrochloride before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Use of Sertraline Hydrochloride With Other MAOIs Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue: Do not start Sertraline hydrochloride in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In some cases, a patient already receiving Sertraline hydrochloride therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, Sertraline hydrochloride should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with Sertraline hydrochloride may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see WARNINGS ). The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with Sertraline hydrochloride is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use (see WARNINGS ). Special Populations Dosage for Hepatically Impaired Patients –The use of sertraline in patients with liver disease should be approached with caution. The effects of sertraline in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. If sertraline is administered to patients with liver impairment, a lower or less frequent dose should be used (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS ). Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester –Neonates exposed to Sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS ). When treating pregnant women with Sertraline hydrochloride during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. Discontinuation of Treatment with Sertraline hydrochloride Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs and SNRIs, have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Major Depressive Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in six to eight week controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III category of major depressive disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). A major depressive episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The antidepressant action of sertraline hydrochloride in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied. The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of open-label acute treatment (52 weeks total) was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. The usefulness of the drug in patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should be reevaluated periodically (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as defined in the DSM-III-R; i.e., the obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in 12-week trials with obsessive-compulsive outpatients having diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder as defined according to DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response, in patients with OCD who responded during a 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Panic Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder in adults, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in three 10-12 week trials in adult panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-III-R category of panic disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response, in adult patients with panic disorder who responded during a 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) – Sertraline hydrochloride (sertraline hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PTSD was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnosis met criteria for the DSM-III-R category of PTSD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). PTSD, as defined by DSM-III-R/IV, requires exposure to a traumatic event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and a response which involves intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Symptoms that occur as a result of exposure to the traumatic event include reexperiencing of the event in the form of intrusive thoughts, flashbacks or dreams, and intense psychological distress and physiological reactivity on exposure to cues to the event; avoidance of situations reminiscent of the traumatic event, inability to recall details of the event, and/or numbing of general responsiveness manifested as diminished interest in significant activities, estrangement from others, restricted range of affect, or sense of foreshortened future; and symptoms of autonomic arousal including hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, and irritability or outbursts of anger. A PTSD diagnosis requires that the symptoms are present for at least a month and that they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with PTSD for up to 28 weeks following 24 weeks of open-label treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in adults. The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PMDD was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials of female adult outpatients treated for 3 menstrual cycles who met criteria for the DSM-IIIR/IV category of PMDD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). The essential features of PMDD include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school or with usual social activities and relationships with others. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders that may be exacerbated by treatment with an antidepressant. The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Social Anxiety Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of social anxiety disorder was established in two placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Social anxiety disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, is characterized by marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others and by fears of acting in a humiliating or embarrassing way. Exposure to the feared social situation almost always provokes anxiety and feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress. In addition, patients recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable and the avoidance and anticipatory anxiety of the feared situation is associated with functional impairment or marked distress. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with social anxiety disorder for up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Physicians who prescribe Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ).","OVERDOSAGE Human Experience – Of 1,027 cases of overdose involving sertraline hydrochloride worldwide, alone or with other drugs, there were 72 deaths (circa 1999). Among 634 overdoses in which sertraline hydrochloride was the only drug ingested, 8 resulted in fatal outcome, 75 completely recovered, and 27 patients experienced sequelae after overdosage to include alopecia, decreased libido, diarrhea, ejaculation disorder, fatigue, insomnia, somnolence and serotonin syndrome. The remaining 524 cases had an unknown outcome. The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal sertraline hydrochloride overdosage were somnolence, vomiting, tachycardia, nausea, dizziness, agitation and tremor. The largest known ingestion was 13.5 grams in a patient who took sertraline hydrochloride alone and subsequently recovered. However, another patient who took 2.5 grams of sertraline hydrochloride alone experienced a fatal outcome. Other important adverse events reported with sertraline hydrochloride overdose (single or multiple drugs) include bradycardia, bundle branch block, coma, convulsions, delirium, hallucinations, hypertension, hypotension, manic reaction, pancreatitis, QT-interval prolongation, serotonin syndrome, stupor and syncope. Overdose Management –Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any antidepressant. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be administered. Due to large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidotes for sertraline are known. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center on the treatment of any overdose. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference ® (PDR®).",Proficient Rx LP,SERTRALINE HYDROCHLORIDE

Allow tablet to dissolve without swallowing. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. • At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are a nitrate vasodilator indicated for relief of an attack or prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. ( 1 ),"10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use.

Overdosage with cholinesterase inhibitors can result in cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea, vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved. Tertiary anticholinergics such as atropine may be used as an antidote for ARICEPT overdosage. Intravenous atropine sulfate titrated to effect is recommended: an initial dose of 1.0 to 2.0 mg IV with subsequent doses based upon clinical response. Atypical responses in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported with other cholinomimetics when co-administered with quaternary anticholinergics such as glycopyrrolate. It is not known whether ARICEPT and/or its metabolites can be removed by dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration). Dose-related signs of toxicity in animals included reduced spontaneous movement, prone position, staggering gait, lacrimation, clonic convulsions, depressed respiration, salivation, miosis, tremors, fasciculation, and lower body surface temperature.",Eisai Inc.,DONEPEZIL HYDROCHLORIDE

( 2.2 ) Important Limitation : Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Adults The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of NORVASC is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding NORVASC to other antihypertensive therapy. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titrate more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently. Angina : The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5–10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect. Coronary artery disease: The recommended dose range for patients with coronary artery disease is 5–10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . 2.2 Children The effective antihypertensive oral dose in pediatric patients ages 6–17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ] .","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE NORVASC is a calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of: • Hypertension ( 1.1 ) o NORVASC is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. • Coronary Artery Disease ( 1.2 ) o Chronic Stable Angina o Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal’s or Variant Angina) o Angiographically Documented Coronary Artery Disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40% 1.1 Hypertension NORVASC ® is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including NORVASC. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. NORVASC may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina NORVASC is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. NORVASC may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal’s or Variant Angina) NORVASC is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. NORVASC may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, NORVASC is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.","10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly a reflex tachycardia. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of NORVASC is limited. Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine/kg and 100 mg amlodipine/kg in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As NORVASC is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit.",Viatris Specialty LLC,AMLODIPINE BESYLATE

The removable cap of the COSENTYX 150 mg/mL Sensoready pen and the COSENTYX prefilled syringes (150 mg/mL, 75 mg/0.5 mL) contain natural rubber latex and should not be handled by latex-sensitive individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Inspect COSENTYX visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. COSENTYX injection is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use if the liquid contains visible particles, is discolored or cloudy. Discard any unused product. 2.11 Preparation and Administration of COSENTYX for Intravenous Use COSENTYX (for intravenous use) must be diluted prior to infusion. Using aseptic technique, prepare COSENTYX (for intravenous use) as follows: Step 1. Volume Calculation Calculate the total volume of COSENTYX for intravenous use solution (in mL) required based on the patient’s actual body weight as follows: Loading dose (6 mg/kg) is 0.24 mL/kg Maintenance dose (1.75 mg/kg) is 0.07 mL/kg Use the number of vials based on total volume needed (one vial contains 5 mL of COSENTYX solution). Step 2. Dilution Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if particulates or discolorations are noted. Follow Table 1 for recommended infusion bag size based on patient's body weight. Table 1: Recommended Infusion Bags for Dilution and Preparation of COSENTYX for Intravenous Use Based on Body Weight and Dose * If a 50 mL infusion bag is unavailable, then use a 100 mL infusion bag and withdraw and discard 50 mL of saline using aseptic technique and continue to follow the preparation and administration steps. Body weight at time of dosing For the loading dose (6 mg/kg) recommended infusion bag For maintenance dose (1.75 mg/kg) recommended infusion bag Greater than 52 kg 100 mL 100 mL Less than or equal to 52 kg 100 mL 50 mL * From the infusion bag, withdraw and discard a volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, equal to the calculated volume of the COSENTYX solution required for the patient’s dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.6, 2.7)] . From the vial(s), withdraw the calculated volume (mL) of COSENTYX solution and add slowly into the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP infusion bag. To mix the solution, gently invert the bag to avoid foaming. Do not shake. Discard unused COSENTYX product in vials because it does not contain preservatives. Allow the diluted COSENTYX solution for infusion to warm to room temperature prior to the start of the intravenous infusion. Administer the diluted COSENTYX solution for infusion as soon as possible. If not administered immediately, store the diluted solution either: At room temperature 20ºC to 25ºC (68ºF to 77ºF) for no more than 4.5 hours from the start of the preparation (piercing the first vial) to the completion of infusion. Under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for no more than 24 hours, from the start of the time of the preparation (piercing the first vial) to the completion of infusion. This time includes the refrigeration of the diluted solution and the time to allow the diluted solution to warm to room temperature. Protect the diluted solution from light during storage under refrigeration. Step 3. Administration Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Administer the infusion at a flow rate of about 3.3 mL/minute for a 100 mL bag or 1.7 mL/min for a 50 mL bag (total administration time: 30 minutes). When administration is complete, flush the line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to guarantee that all the COSENTYX solution for infusion in the line has been administered. Do not infuse COSENTYX concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other drugs. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the IV coadministration of COSENTYX with other drugs.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE COSENTYX is a human interleukin-17A antagonist indicated for the treatment of: moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) in patients 6 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.

The recommended weight-based dosage in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older with ERA is administered by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter: For patients ≥ 15 kg and < 50 kg, the recommended dose is 75 mg. For patients ≥ 50 kg, the recommended dose is 150 mg. 2.9 Recommended Dosage in Hidradenitis Suppurativa The recommended dose in adult patients with moderate to severe HS is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter. If a patient does not adequately respond, consider increasing the dosage to 300 mg every 2 weeks. Each 300 mg dosage is given as one subcutaneous injection of 300 mg or as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. 2.10 Preparation for Use of COSENTYX UnoReady Pen, Sensoready Pen and Prefilled Syringes COSENTYX UnoReady pens, Sensoready pens and prefilled syringes are for subcutaneous injection only. Before subcutaneous injection, remove COSENTYX from the refrigerator and allow COSENTYX to reach room temperature (15 to 30 minutes for the Sensoready pen, the 150 mg/mL and 75 mg/0.5 mL prefilled syringes; 30 to 45 minutes for the UnoReady pen and the 300 mg/2 mL prefilled syringe) without removing the needle cap. The removable cap of the COSENTYX 150 mg/mL Sensoready pen and the COSENTYX prefilled syringes (150 mg/mL, 75 mg/0.5 mL) contain natural rubber latex and should not be handled by latex-sensitive individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Inspect COSENTYX visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. COSENTYX injection is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use if the liquid contains visible particles, is discolored or cloudy. Discard any unused product. 2.11 Preparation and Administration of COSENTYX for Intravenous Use COSENTYX (for intravenous use) must be diluted prior to infusion. Using aseptic technique, prepare COSENTYX (for intravenous use) as follows: Step 1. Volume Calculation Calculate the total volume of COSENTYX for intravenous use solution (in mL) required based on the patient’s actual body weight as follows: Loading dose (6 mg/kg) is 0.24 mL/kg Maintenance dose (1.75 mg/kg) is 0.07 mL/kg Use the number of vials based on total volume needed (one vial contains 5 mL of COSENTYX solution). Step 2. Dilution Parenteral drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if particulates or discolorations are noted. Follow Table 1 for recommended infusion bag size based on patient's body weight. Table 1: Recommended Infusion Bags for Dilution and Preparation of COSENTYX for Intravenous Use Based on Body Weight and Dose * If a 50 mL infusion bag is unavailable, then use a 100 mL infusion bag and withdraw and discard 50 mL of saline using aseptic technique and continue to follow the preparation and administration steps. Body weight at time of dosing For the loading dose (6 mg/kg) recommended infusion bag For maintenance dose (1.75 mg/kg) recommended infusion bag Greater than 52 kg 100 mL 100 mL Less than or equal to 52 kg 100 mL 50 mL * From the infusion bag, withdraw and discard a volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, equal to the calculated volume of the COSENTYX solution required for the patient’s dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.6, 2.7)] . From the vial(s), withdraw the calculated volume (mL) of COSENTYX solution and add slowly into the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP infusion bag. To mix the solution, gently invert the bag to avoid foaming. Do not shake. Discard unused COSENTYX product in vials because it does not contain preservatives. Allow the diluted COSENTYX solution for infusion to warm to room temperature prior to the start of the intravenous infusion. Administer the diluted COSENTYX solution for infusion as soon as possible. If not administered immediately, store the diluted solution either: At room temperature 20ºC to 25ºC (68ºF to 77ºF) for no more than 4.5 hours from the start of the preparation (piercing the first vial) to the completion of infusion. Under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for no more than 24 hours, from the start of the time of the preparation (piercing the first vial) to the completion of infusion. This time includes the refrigeration of the diluted solution and the time to allow the diluted solution to warm to room temperature. Protect the diluted solution from light during storage under refrigeration. Step 3. Administration Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.2 micrometer). Administer the infusion at a flow rate of about 3.3 mL/minute for a 100 mL bag or 1.7 mL/min for a 50 mL bag (total administration time: 30 minutes). When administration is complete, flush the line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to guarantee that all the COSENTYX solution for infusion in the line has been administered. Do not infuse COSENTYX concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other drugs. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the IV coadministration of COSENTYX with other drugs.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE COSENTYX is a human interleukin-17A antagonist indicated for the treatment of: moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) in patients 6 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.

Therefore, adjust the dosing interval of TRUVADA in HIV-1 infected adult patients with baseline creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min using the recommendations in Table 2. These dosing interval recommendations are based on modeling of single-dose pharmacokinetic data in non-HIV infected subjects. The safety and effectiveness of these dosing interval adjustment recommendations have not been clinically evaluated in patients with moderate renal impairment, therefore clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . No dose adjustment is necessary for HIV-1 infected patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50–80 mL/min). No data are available to make dose recommendations in pediatric patients with renal impairment.

( 1 ) 1.1 Treatment of HIV-1 Infection TRUVADA ® , a combination of EMTRIVA ® and VIREAD ® , is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 17 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with TRUVADA for the treatment of HIV-1 infection:The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with TRUVADA for the treatment of HIV-1 infection: It is not recommended that TRUVADA be used as a component of a triple nucleoside regimen. TRUVADA should not be coadministered with ATRIPLA ® , COMPLERA ® , EMTRIVA, GENVOYA ® , ODEFSEY ® , STRIBILD ® , VIREAD or lamivudine-containing products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In treatment experienced patients, the use of TRUVADA should be guided by laboratory testing and treatment history [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 1.2 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis TRUVADA is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 in adults at high risk. This indication is based on clinical trials in men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk for HIV-1 infection and in heterosexual serodiscordant couples [see Clinical Studies (14.2 , 14.3) ] . When considering TRUVADA for pre-exposure prophylaxis the following factors may help to identify individuals at high risk: has partner(s) known to be HIV-1 infected, or engages in sexual activity within a high prevalence area or social network and one or more of the following: inconsistent or no condom use diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections exchange of sex for commodities (such as money, food, shelter, or drugs) use of illicit drugs or alcohol dependence incarceration partner(s) of unknown HIV-1 status with any of the factors listed above When prescribing TRUVADA for pre-exposure prophylaxis, healthcare providers must: prescribe TRUVADA as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] ; counsel all uninfected individuals to strictly adhere to the recommended TRUVADA dosing schedule because the effectiveness of TRUVADA in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 was strongly correlated with adherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] ; confirm a negative HIV-1 test immediately prior to initiating TRUVADA for a PrEP indication. If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (<1 month) exposures are suspected, delay starting PrEP for at least one month and reconfirm HIV-1 status or use a test approved by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, including acute or primary HIV-1 infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] ; and screen for HIV-1 infection at least once every 3 months while taking TRUVADA for PrEP.","10 OVERDOSAGE If overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity, and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. Emtricitabine: Limited clinical experience is available at doses higher than the therapeutic dose of EMTRIVA. In one clinical pharmacology trial, single doses of emtricitabine 1200 mg were administered to 11 subjects. No severe adverse reactions were reported. Hemodialysis treatment removes approximately 30% of the emtricitabine dose over a 3-hour dialysis period starting within 1.5 hours of emtricitabine dosing (blood flow rate of 400 mL/min and a dialysate flow rate of 600 mL/min). It is not known whether emtricitabine can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate: Limited clinical experience at doses higher than the therapeutic dose of VIREAD 300 mg is available. In one trial, 600 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was administered to 8 subjects orally for 28 days, and no severe adverse reactions were reported. The effects of higher doses are not known. Tenofovir is efficiently removed by hemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately 54%. Following a single 300 mg dose of VIREAD, a four-hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 10% of the administered tenofovir dose.","NuCare Pharmaceuticals,Inc.",EMTRICITABINE AND TENOFOVIR DISOPROXIL FUMARATE

HIV-1 PrEP ( 1.2 ): DESCOVY is indicated in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection from sexual acquisition, excluding individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex. Individuals must have a negative HIV-1 test immediately prior to initiating DESCOVY for HIV-1 PrEP. Limitations of Use ( 1.2 ): The indication does not include use of DESCOVY in individuals at risk of HIV-1 from receptive vaginal sex because effectiveness in this population has not been evaluated. 1.1 Treatment of HIV-1 Infection DESCOVY is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg. DESCOVY is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral agents other than protease inhibitors that require a CYP3A inhibitor, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg and less than 35 kg. 1.2 HIV-1 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) DESCOVY is indicated in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection from sexual acquisition, excluding individuals at risk from receptive vaginal sex. Individuals must have a negative HIV-1 test immediately prior to initiating DESCOVY for HIV-1 PrEP [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Limitations of Use: The indication does not include use of DESCOVY in individuals at risk of HIV-1 from receptive vaginal sex because effectiveness in this population has not been evaluated [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ].","10 OVERDOSAGE No data are available on overdose of DESCOVY in patients. If overdose occurs, monitor the individual for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with DESCOVY consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the individual. Emtricitabine (FTC): Limited clinical experience is available at doses higher than the recommended dose of FTC in DESCOVY. In one clinical pharmacology study, single doses of FTC 1200 mg (6 times the FTC dose in DESCOVY) were administered to 11 subjects. No severe adverse reactions were reported. The effects of higher doses are not known. Hemodialysis treatment removes approximately 30% of the FTC dose over a 3-hour dialysis period starting within 1.5 hours of FTC dosing (blood flow rate of 400 mL per minute and a dialysate flow rate of 600 mL per minute). It is not known whether FTC can be removed by peritoneal dialysis. Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) : Limited clinical experience is available at doses higher than the recommended dose of TAF. A single dose of 125 mg TAF (5 times the TAF dose in 200/25 mg DESCOVY) was administered to 48 healthy subjects; no serious adverse reactions were reported. The effects of higher doses are unknown. Tenofovir is efficiently removed by hemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately 54%.","Gilead Sciences, Inc.",EMTRICITABINE AND TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE
LYRICA,N/A,N/A,Dyslipidaemia,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • LYRICA CR should be administered once daily after an evening meal. It should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed, or chewed. ( 2.1 ) • Dosing recommendations for LYRICA CR: Indication Dosing Regimen Initial Dose Maximum Dose DPN Pain ( 2.2 ) Single dose per day 165 mg/day 330 mg/day within 1 week. PHN ( 2.3 ) Single dose per day 165 mg/day 330 mg/day within 1 week. Maximum dose of 660 mg/day. • Conversion from LYRICA Capsules or Oral Solution to LYRICA CR: See full prescribing information. ( 2.4 ) • Dose modification recommended in patients with renal impairment. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions LYRICA CR should be administered once daily after an evening meal. LYRICA CR should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed, or chewed. When discontinuing LYRICA CR, taper gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Instruct patients that if they miss taking their dose of LYRICA CR after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of LYRICA CR prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of LYRICA CR prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of LYRICA CR following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of LYRICA CR following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of LYRICA CR at the usual time that evening following an evening meal [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 2.2 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Begin dosing at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of LYRICA CR is 330 mg once daily. Although LYRICA was studied at 600 mg/day, there was no evidence that this dose conferred additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions with LYRICA, treatment with doses above 330 mg/day is not recommended for LYRICA CR. 2.3 Postherpetic Neuralgia Begin dosing at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate LYRICA CR, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of LYRICA CR is 660 mg once daily. 2.4 Conversion from LYRICA Capsules or Oral Solution to LYRICA CR When switching from LYRICA to LYRICA CR on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of LYRICA as prescribed and initiate LYRICA CR therapy after an evening meal. Table 1. Conversion from LYRICA Capsules or Oral Solution to LYRICA CR LYRICA Total Daily Dose (dosed 2 or 3 times daily) LYRICA CR Dose (dosed once a day) 75 mg/daily 82.5 mg/day 150 mg/daily 165 mg/day 225 mg/daily 247.5 mg/day 247.5 mg = 3 × 82.5 mg tablets taken once a day. 300 mg/daily 330 mg/day 450 mg/daily 495 mg/day 495 mg = 3 × 165 mg tablets taken once a day. 600 mg/daily 660 mg/day 660 mg = 2 × 330 mg tablets taken once a day. 2.5 Patients with Renal Impairment Use of LYRICA CR is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) less than 30 mL/min or who are undergoing hemodialysis. Those patients should receive LYRICA. In view of dose-dependent adverse reactions and because pregabalin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in patients with reduced renal function. Base the dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment on CLcr, as indicated in Table 2. To use the dosing tables, an estimate of the patient's CLcr in mL/min is needed. CLcr in mL/min may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the Cockcroft and Gault equation: Next, refer to the Dosage and Administration section to determine the recommended total daily dose based on indication, for a patient with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min). Then refer to Table 2 to determine the corresponding renal adjusted dose. (For example: A patient initiating LYRICA CR therapy for postherpetic neuralgia with normal renal function [CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min], receives a single daily dose of 165 mg/day pregabalin. Therefore, a renal impaired patient with a CLcr of 50 mL/min would receive a single daily dose of 82.5 mg.) Table 2. LYRICA CR Dosage Adjustment Based on Renal Function Creatinine Clearance (CLcr) (mL/min) Total LYRICA CR Daily Dose (mg/day) Dose Regimen greater than or equal to 60 165 330 495 495 mg = 3 × 165 mg tablets taken once a day. 660 660 mg = 2 × 330 mg tablets taken once a day.

Seizures and heart block have also been reported. Deaths have been reported in the setting of lone LYRICA overdose and in combination with other CNS depressants. Treatment or Management of Overdose There is no specific antidote for overdose with pregabalin. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug may be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; observe usual precautions to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for up-to-date information on the management of overdose with pregabalin. Pregabalin can be removed by hemodialysis. Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of pregabalin (approximately 50% in 4 hours).",Parke-Davis Div of Pfizer Inc,PREGABALIN

After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Patients should be instructed to prime PULMICORT FLEXHALER prior to its initial use, and instructed to inhale deeply and forcefully each time the device is used. The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER when administered in excess of recommended doses have not been established. After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1-2 weeks of therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, increasing the dose may provide additional asthma control. For oral inhalation only. Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily. (2.1) Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: The recommended starting dosage is 180 mcg twice daily. In some pediatric patients, a starting dose of 360 mcg twice daily may be appropriate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 360 mcg twice daily. (2.1) 2.1 Asthma If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist should be taken for immediate relief. Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily.

CARBAMAZEPINE,74,801,Drug intolerance,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests ). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patients. A low initial daily dosage with gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be taken with or without food. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be swallowed whole or may be opened and all the beads sprinkled on a teaspoon of soft food such as applesauce. Make sure all of the food and medicine mixture is swallowed. Do not crush or chew carbamazepine extended-release capsules or the sprinkled beads. Carbamazepine extended-release capsule is an extended-release formulation for twice a day administration. When converting patients from immediate release carbamazepine to carbamazepine extended-release capsules, the same total daily mg dose of carbamazepine should be administered. Following conversion to carbamazepine, patients should be closely monitored for seizure control. Depending on the therapeutic response after conversion, the total daily dose may need to be adjusted within the recommended dosing instructions. Epilepsy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Adults and children over 12 years of age. Initial: 200 mg twice daily. Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1,000 mg per day in children 12 to 15 years of age, and 1,200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1,600 mg daily have been used in adults. Maintenance: Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 800 to 1,200 mg daily. Children under 12 years of age: Children taking total daily dosages of immediate-release carbamazepine of 400 mg or greater may be converted to the same total daily dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules, using a twice daily regimen. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of carbamazepine extended-release capsules for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made. Combination Therapy: Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Trigeminal Neuralgia (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Initial: On the first day, start with one 200 mg capsule. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day every 12 hours only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. Do not exceed 1,200 mg daily. Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400 to 800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Epilepsy Carbamazepine extended-release capsules are indicated for use as an anticonvulsant drug. Evidence supporting efficacy of carbamazepine as an anticonvulsant was derived from active drug-controlled studies that enrolled patients with the following seizure types: Partial seizures with complex symptomatology (psychomotor, temporal lobe). Patients with these seizures appear to show greater improvements than those with other types. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). Mixed seizure patterns which include the above, or other partial or generalized seizures. Absence seizures (petit mal) do not appear to be controlled by carbamazepine (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Trigeminal Neuralgia Carbamazepine extended-release capsules are indicated in the treatment of the pain associated with true trigeminal neuralgia. Beneficial results have also been reported in glossopharyngeal neuralgia. This drug is not a simple analgesic and should not be used for the relief of trivial aches or pains.","OVERDOSAGE Acute Toxicity Lowest known lethal dose: adults, >60 g (39-year-old man). Highest known doses survived: adults, 30 g (31-year-old woman); children, 10 g (6-year-old boy); small children, 5 g (3-year-old girl). Oral LD 50 in animals (mg/kg): mice, 1100 to 3750; rats, 3850 to 4025; rabbits, 1500 to 2680; guinea pigs, 920. Signs and Symptoms The first signs and symptoms appear after 1 to 3 hours. Neuromuscular disturbances are the most prominent. Cardiovascular disorders are generally milder, and severe cardiac complications occur only when very high doses (>60 g) have been ingested. Respiration: Irregular breathing, respiratory depression. Cardiovascular System: Tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension, shock, conduction disorders. Nervous System and Muscles: Impairment of consciousness ranging in severity to deep coma. Convulsions, especially in small children. Motor restlessness, muscular twitching, tremor, athetoid movements, opisthotonos, ataxia, drowsiness, dizziness, mydriasis, nystagmus, adiadochokinesia, ballism, psychomotor disturbances, dysmetria. Initial hyperreflexia, followed by hyporeflexia. Gastrointestinal Tract: Nausea, vomiting. Kidneys and Bladder: Anuria or oliguria, urinary retention. Laboratory Findings: Isolated instances of overdosage have included leukocytosis, reduced leukocyte count, glycosuria, and acetonuria. ECG may show dysrhythmias. Combined Poisoning: When alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, or hydantoins are taken at the same time, the signs and symptoms of acute poisoning with carbamazepine may be aggravated or modified. Treatment For the most up to date information on management of carbamazepine overdose, please contact the poison center for your area by calling 1-800-222-1222. The prognosis in cases of carbamazepine poisoning is generally favorable. Of 5,645 cases of carbamazepine exposures reported to US poison centers in 2002, a total of 8 deaths (0.14% mortality rate) occurred. Over 39% of the cases reported to these poison centers were managed safely at home with conservative care. Successful management of large or intentional carbamazepine exposures requires implementation of supportive care, frequent monitoring of serum drug concentrations, as well as aggressive but appropriate gastric decontamination. Elimination of the Drug: The primary method for gastric decontamination of carbamazepine overdose is use of activated charcoal. For substantial recent ingestions, gastric lavage may also be considered. Administration of activated charcoal prior to hospital assessment has the potential to significantly reduce drug absorption. There is no specific antidote. In overdose, absorption of carbamazepine may be prolonged and delayed. More than one dose of activated charcoal may be beneficial in patients that have evidence of continued absorption (e.g., rising serum carbamazepine levels). Measures to Accelerate Elimination: The data on use of dialysis to enhance elimination in carbamazepine is scarce. Dialysis, particularly high flux or high efficiency hemodialysis, may be considered in patients with severe carbamazepine poisoning associated with renal failure or in cases of status epilepticus, or where there are rising serum drug levels and worsening clinical status despite appropriate supportive care and gastric decontamination. For severe cases of carbamazepine overdose unresponsive to other measures, charcoal hemoperfusion may be used to enhance drug clearance. Respiratory Depression: Keep the airways free; resort, if necessary, to endotracheal intubation, artificial respiration, and administration of oxygen. Hypotension, Shock: Keep the patient's legs raised and administer a plasma expander. If blood pressure fails to rise despite measures taken to increase plasma volume, use of vasoactive substances should be considered. Convulsions: Diazepam or barbiturates. Warning: Diazepam or barbiturates may aggravate respiratory depression (especially in children), hypotension, and coma. However, barbiturates should not be used if drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase have also been taken by the patient either in overdosage or in recent therapy (within 1 week). Surveillance: Respiration, cardiac function (ECG monitoring), blood pressure, body temperature, pupillary reflexes, and kidney and bladder function should be monitored for several days. Treatment of Blood Count Abnormalities: If evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops, the following recommendations are suggested: (1) stop the drug, (2) perform daily CBC, platelet, and reticulocyte counts, (3) do a bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy immediately and repeat with sufficient frequency to monitor recovery. Special periodic studies might be helpful as follows: (1) white cell and platelet antibodies, (2) 59 Fe-ferrokinetic studies, (3) peripheral blood cell typing, (4) cytogenetic studies on marrow and peripheral blood, (5) bone marrow culture studies for colony-forming units, (6) hemoglobin electrophoresis for A2 and F hemoglobin, and (7) serum folic acid and B 12 levels. A fully developed aplastic anemia will require appropriate, intensive monitoring and therapy, for which specialized consultation should be sought.",Bryant Ranch Prepack,CARBAMAZEPINE

The recommended dose is reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days Dose should be adjusted in patients with reduced renal function ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage for Postherpetic Neuralgia In adults with postherpetic neuralgia, Gabapentin may be initiated on Day 1 as a single 300 mg dose, on Day 2 as 600 mg/day (300 mg two times a day), and on Day 3 as 900 mg/day (300 mg three times a day). The dose can subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a dose of 1800 mg/day (600 mg three times a day). In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with comparable effects across the dose range; however, in these clinical studies, the additional benefit of using doses greater than 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated 2.2 Dosage for Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures Patients 12 years of age and above The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. The recommended maintenance dose of Gabapentin is 300 mg to 600 mg three times a day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies. Doses of 3600 mg/day have also been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short duration, and have been well tolerated. Administer Gabapentin three times a day using 300 mg or 400 mg capsules. The maximum time between doses should not exceed 12 hours. Pediatric Patients Age 3 to 11 years The starting dose range is 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses, and the recommended maintenance dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days. The recommended maintenance dose of Gabapentin in patients 3 to 4 years of age is 40 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. The recommended maintenance dose of Gabapentin in patients 5 to 11 years of age is 25 mg/kg/day to 35 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. Gabapentin may be administered as the capsule formulations. Dosages up to 50 mg/kg/day have been well tolerated in a long-term clinical study. The maximum time interval between doses should not exceed 12 hours. 2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment in patients 12 years of age and older with renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended, as follows (see dosing recommendations above for effective doses in each indication): TABLE 1. Gabapentin Dosage Based on Renal Function TID = Three times a day; BID = Two times a day; QD = Single daily dose Renal Function Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) Total Daily Dose Range (mg/day) Dose Regimen (mg) ≥60 900 to 3600 300 TID 400 TID 600 TID 800 TID 1200 TID >30 to 59 400 to 1400 200 BID 300 BID 400 BID 500 BID 700 BID >15 to 29 200 to 700 200 QD 300 QD 400 QD 500 QD 700 QD 15 For patients with creatinine clearance <15 mL/min, reduce daily dose in proportion to creatinine clearance (e.g., patients with a creatinine clearance of 7.5 mL/min should receive one-half the daily dose that patients with a creatinine clearance of 15 mL/min receive) 100 to 300 100 QD 125 QD 150 QD 200 QD 300 QD Post-Hemodialysis Supplemental Dose (mg) Patients on hemodialysis should receive maintenance doses based on estimates of creatinine clearance as indicated in the upper portion of the table and a supplemental post-hemodialysis dose administered after each 4 hours of hemodialysis as indicated in the lower portion of the table. Hemodialysis 125 150 200 250 350 Creatinine clearance (CLCr) is diffcult to measure in outpatients. In patients with stable renal function, creatinine clearance can be reasonably well estimated using the equation of Cockcroft and Gault: The use of Gabapentin in patients less than 12 years of age with compromised renal function has not been studied. 2.4 Dosage in Elderly Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and dose should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance values in these patients. 2.5 Administration Information Administer Gabapentin orally with or without food. Gabapentin capsules should be swallowed whole with water. If the Gabapentin dose is reduced, discontinued, or substituted with an alternative medication, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week (a longer period may be needed at the discretion of the prescriber).","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Gabapentin Capsules, USP are indicated for: Management of postherpetic neuralgia in adults Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures, with and without secondary generalization, in adults and pediatric patients 3 years and older with epilepsy Gabapentin Capsules, USP are indicated for Postherpetic neuralgia in adults (1) Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures, with and without secondary generalization, in adults and pediatric patients 3 years and older with epilepsy (1)","10 OVERDOSAGE Signs of acute toxicity in animals included ataxia, labored breathing, ptosis, sedation, hypoactivity, or excitation.

ETONOGESTREL,33,801,Suicidal ideation,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION One Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is inserted in the vagina. The ring must remain in place continuously for three weeks, followed by a one-week ring-free interval. ( 2 ) 2.1 How to Use Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring must be used as directed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. One Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is inserted in the vagina. The ring is to remain in place continuously for three weeks. It is removed for a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs. A new ring is inserted one week after the last ring was removed. The user can choose the insertion position that is most comfortable to her, for example, standing with one leg up, squatting, or lying down. The ring is to be compressed and inserted into the vagina. An optional alternative is to insert the ring using the applicator for Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring [see Applicator for Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring Instructions for Use ]. The exact position of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring inside the vagina is not critical for its function. The vaginal ring must be inserted on the appropriate day and left in place for three consecutive weeks. This means that the ring should be removed three weeks later on the same day of the week as it was inserted and at about the same time. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring can be removed by hooking the index finger under the forward rim or by grasping the rim between the index and middle finger and pulling it out. The used ring should be placed in the sachet (foil pouch) and discarded in a waste receptacle out of the reach of children and pets (do not flush in toilet). After a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs, a new ring is inserted on the same day of the week as it was inserted in the previous cycle. The withdrawal bleed usually starts on Day 2-3 after removal of the ring and may not have finished before the next ring is inserted. In order to maintain contraceptive effectiveness, the new ring must be inserted exactly one week after the previous one was removed even if menstrual bleeding has not finished. 2.2 How to Start Using Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring IMPORTANT: Consider the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to the first use of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. No Hormonal Contraceptive Use in the Preceding Cycle: The woman should insert Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring on the first day of her menstrual bleeding. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring may also be started on Days 2-5 of the woman’s cycle, but in this case a barrier method, such as male condoms with spermicide, should be used for the first seven days of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use in the first cycle. Changing From a CHC: The woman may switch from her previous CHC on any day, but at the latest on the day following the usual hormone-free interval, if she has been using her hormonal method consistently and correctly, or if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant. Changing From a Progestin-Only Method (progestin-only pill [POP], Implant, or Injection or a Progestin-Releasing Intrauterine System [IUS]): The woman may switch from the POP on any day; instruct her to start using Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring on the day after she took her last POP. She should switch from an implant or the IUS on the day of its removal, and from an injectable on the day when the next injection would be due. In all of these cases, the woman should use an additional barrier method such as a male condom with spermicide, for the first seven days. Use After Abortion or Miscarriage: The woman may start using Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring within the first five days following a complete first trimester abortion or miscarriage, and she does not need to use an additional method of contraception. If use of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is not started within five days following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage, the woman should follow the instructions for “No Hormonal Contraceptive Use in the Preceding Cycle.” In the meantime, she should be advised to use a non-hormonal contraceptive method. Start Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring no earlier than four weeks after a second trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. [ See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) .] Following Childbirth: The use of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring may be initiated no sooner than four weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism in the postpartum period. [See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ).] Advise women who are breastfeeding not to use Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring but to use other forms of contraception until the child is weaned. If a woman begins using Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring postpartum, instruct her to use an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, for the first seven days. If she has not yet had a period, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to initiation of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. 2.3 Deviations from the Recommended Regimen To prevent loss of contraceptive efficacy, advise women not to deviate from the recommended regimen. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring should be left in the vagina for a continuous period of three weeks. Advise women to regularly check for the presence of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring in the vagina (for example, before and after intercourse). Inadvertent Removal or Expulsion: Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring can be accidentally expelled, for example, while removing a tampon, during intercourse, or with straining during a bowel movement. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring should be left in the vagina for a continuous period of three weeks. If the ring is accidentally expelled and is left outside of the vagina for less than three hours , contraceptive efficacy is not reduced. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring can be rinsed with cool to lukewarm (not hot) water and reinserted as soon as possible , but at the latest within three hours. If Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is lost, a new vaginal ring should be inserted and the regimen should be continued without alteration. If Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is out of the vagina for more than three continuous hours: During Weeks 1 and 2: Contraceptive efficacy may be reduced. The woman should reinsert the ring as soon as she remembers. A barrier method such as male condoms with spermicides must be used until the ring has been used continuously for seven days. During Week 3: The woman should discard that ring. One of the following two options should be chosen: 1. Insert a new ring immediately. Inserting a new ring will start the next three-week use period. The woman may not experience a withdrawal bleed from her previous cycle. However, breakthrough spotting or bleeding may occur. 2. Insert a new ring no later than seven days from the time the previous ring was removed or expelled, during which time she may have a withdrawal bleed. This option should only be chosen if the ring was used continuously for at least seven days prior to inadvertent removal/expulsion. In either case, a barrier method such as male condoms with spermicides must be used until the new ring has been used continuously for seven days. If Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring was out of the vagina for an unknown amount of time, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered. A pregnancy test should be performed prior to inserting a new ring. Prolonged Ring-Free Interval: If the ring-free interval has been extended beyond one week, consider the possibility of pregnancy, and an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, MUST be used until Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring has been used continuously for seven days. Prolonged Use of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring: If Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring has been left in place for up to one extra week (i.e., up to four weeks total), the woman will remain protected. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring should be removed and the woman should insert a new ring after a one-week ring-free interval. If Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring has been left in place for longer than four weeks, instruct the woman to remove the ring, and rule out pregnancy. If pregnancy is ruled out, Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring may be restarted, and an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, MUST be used until a new Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring has been used continuously for seven days. Ring Breakage: There have been reported cases of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring disconnecting at the weld joint. This is not expected to affect the contraceptive effectiveness of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring. In the event of a disconnected ring, vaginal discomfort or expulsion (slipping out) is more likely to occur. Vaginal injury associated with ring breakage has been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If a woman discovers that her Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring has disconnected, she should discard the ring and replace it with a new ring. 2.4 In the Event of a Missed Menstrual Period 1. If the woman has not adhered to the prescribed regimen (Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring has been out of the vagina for more than three hours or the preceding ring-free interval was extended beyond one week), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and discontinue Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if pregnancy is confirmed. 2. If the woman has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 3. If the woman has retained one Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring for longer than four weeks, rule out pregnancy. 2.5 Use with Other Vaginal Products Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring may interfere with the correct placement and position of certain female barrier methods such as a diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom. These methods are not recommended as back-up methods with Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use. Pharmacokinetic data show that the use of tampons has no effect on the systemic absorption of the hormones released by Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring .",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR VAGINAL USE ONLY Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is indicated for use by females of reproductive age to prevent pregnancy. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is an estrogen/progestin combination hormonal contraceptive (CHC) indicated for use by women to prevent pregnancy. ( 1 ),"10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdose of CHCs. Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea. If the ring breaks, it does not release a higher dose of hormones.

Based upon tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg/day (25 mg twice daily) in the second week. Dosage can be increased by 25 to 50 mg/day each subsequent week as tolerated. Titration to the minimum maintenance dose should be attempted over 5 to 7 weeks of the total titration period. Based upon tolerability and clinical response, additional titration to a higher dose (up to the maximum maintenance dose) can be attempted at 25 to 50 mg/day weekly increments. The total daily dose should not exceed the maximum maintenance dose for each range of body weight (Table 2).

Topiramate tablets should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg/day, followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 to 50 mg/day every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day have not been shown to improve responses in adults with partial-onset seizures. Pediatric Patients 2 to 16 Years of Age The recommended total daily dose of topiramate tablets as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg/day (or less, based on a range of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day) nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg/day. 2.3 Dosing for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine The recommended total daily dose of topiramate tablets as treatment for patients 12 years of age and older for the preventive treatment of migraine is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses (Table 3). The recommended titration rate for topiramate tablets for the preventive treatment of migraine is as follows: Table 3: Preventive Treatment of Migraine Titration Schedule for Patients 12 Years of Age and Older Morning Dose Evening Dose Week 1 None 25 mg Week 2 25 mg 25 mg Week 3 25 mg 50 mg Week 4 50 mg 50 mg Dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome. If required, longer intervals between dose adjustments can be used. 2.4 Administration Information Topiramate tablets can be taken without regard to meals. Topiramate Tablets Because of the bitter taste, tablets should not be broken. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), one-half of the usual adult dose of topiramate tablets is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations 8.5 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.6 Dosing in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis To avoid rapid drops in topiramate plasma concentration during hemodialysis, a supplemental dose of topiramate tablets may be required. The actual adjustment should take into account 1) the duration of dialysis period, 2) the clearance rate of the dialysis system being used, and 3) the effective renal clearance of topiramate in the patient being dialyzed [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Topiramate tablets are indicated for: Epilepsy: initial monotherapy for the treatment of partial-onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 2 years of age and older (1.1); adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older ( 1.2 ) Preventive treatment of migraine in patients 12 years of age and older ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Monotherapy Epilepsy Topiramate tablets are indicated as initial monotherapy for the treatment of partial-onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 2 years of age and older. 1.2 Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy Topiramate tablets are indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older. 1.3 Migraine Topiramate tablets are indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in patients 12 years of age and older.","10 OVERDOSAGE Overdoses of topiramate have been reported. Signs and symptoms included convulsions, drowsiness, speech disturbance, blurred vision, diplopia, impaired mentation, lethargy, abnormal coordination, stupor, hypotension, abdominal pain, agitation, dizziness and depression. The clinical consequences were not severe in most cases, but deaths have been reported after overdoses involving topiramate. Topiramate overdose has resulted in severe metabolic acidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . A patient who ingested a dose of topiramate between 96 and 110 g was admitted to a hospital with a coma lasting 20 to 24 hours followed by full recovery after 3 to 4 days. In the event of overdose, topiramate should be discontinued and general supportive treatment given until clinical toxicity has been diminished or resolved. Hemodialysis is an effective means of removing topiramate from the body.","Quality Care Products, LLC",TOPIRAMATE
LISINOPRIL,N/A,N/A,Myocardial infarction,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10 mg to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component. The side effects (see WARNINGS ) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects, but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10-12.5 or lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20-12.5. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2-3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar or greater blood pressure control with less potassium loss if they are switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10-12.5. Dosage higher than lisinopril 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg should not be used. Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components. Use in Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets need not be adjusted as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (serum creatinine approximately less than or equal to 3 mg/dL or 265 μmol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure ).","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk. (See WARNINGS .) In considering use of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, it should be noted that Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-Black. (See WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema .)","OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued and the patient observed closely. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage, and correction of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and hypotension by established procedures. Lisinopril Following a single oral dose of 20 g/kg no lethality occurred in rats and death occurred in one of 20 mice receiving the same dose. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension, for which the usual treatment would be intravenous infusion of normal saline solution. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid reaction during membrane exposure ). Hydrochlorothiazide Oral administration of a single oral dose of 10 g/kg to mice and rats was not lethal. The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis.

TRELEGY ELLIPTA,N/A,N/A,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION BREO ELLIPTA should be administered once daily every day by the orally inhaled route only. BREO ELLIPTA should be taken at the same time every day. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA more than 1 time every 24 hours. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 1 inhalation daily) of the prescribed strength of BREO ELLIPTA is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses. Patients using BREO ELLIPTA should not use additional LABA for any reason. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5, 5.8, 5.12).] • For oral inhalation only. ( 2 ) • Maintenance treatment of COPD: 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily. ( 2.1 ) • Asthma: 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 should be administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily, the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD. If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be taken for immediate relief. 2.2 Asthma If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be taken for immediate relief. The recommended starting dosage is BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily. The starting dosage is based on patients’ asthma severity. For patients previously treated with low- to mid-dose corticosteroid–containing treatment, BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 should be considered. For patients previously treated with mid- to high-dose corticosteroid–containing treatment, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 should be considered. The median time to onset, defined as a 100-mL increase from baseline in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), was approximately 15 minutes after beginning treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, increasing the dose to BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 may provide additional improvement in asthma control. If a previously effective dosage regimen of BREO ELLIPTA fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of BREO ELLIPTA with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BREO ELLIPTA is a combination of fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol, a long-acting beta 2 ‑adrenergic agonist (LABA), indicated for: • Long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction and reducing exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (1.1) • Once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. ( 1.2 ) Important limitation: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm. ( 1.1 , 1.2 , 5.2 ) 1.1 Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease BREO ® ELLIPTA ® 100/25 is a combination inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (ICS/LABA) indicated for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily is the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD. Important Limitation of Use BREO ELLIPTA is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. 1.2 Treatment of Asthma BREO ELLIPTA is a combination ICS/LABA indicated for the once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, physicians should only prescribe BREO ELLIPTA for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue BREO ELLIPTA) if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Important Limitation of Use BREO ELLIPTA is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.","10 OVERDOSAGE No human overdosage data has been reported for BREO ELLIPTA. BREO ELLIPTA contains both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to BREO ELLIPTA. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of BREO ELLIPTA together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta‑receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medicine can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage. 10.1 Fluticasone Furoate Because of low systemic bioavailability (15.2%) and an absence of acute drug-related systemic findings in clinical trials, overdosage of fluticasone furoate is unlikely to require any treatment other than observation. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic effects such as hypercorticism may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Single- and repeat-dose trials of fluticasone furoate at doses of 50 to 4,000 mcg have been studied in human subjects. Decreases in mean serum cortisol were observed at dosages of 500 mcg or higher given once daily for 14 days. 10.2 Vilanterol The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of vilanterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis). As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medicines, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of vilanterol.",N/A,N/A

NORVASC,N/A,N/A,Bladder cancer,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Adult recommended starting dose: 5 mg once daily with maximum dose 10 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) o Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) • Pediatric starting dose: 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. ( 2.2 ) Important Limitation : Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Adults The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of NORVASC is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding NORVASC to other antihypertensive therapy. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titrate more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently. Angina : The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5–10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect. Coronary artery disease: The recommended dose range for patients with coronary artery disease is 5–10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . 2.2 Children The effective antihypertensive oral dose in pediatric patients ages 6–17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ] .","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE NORVASC is a calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of: • Hypertension ( 1.1 ) o NORVASC is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. • Coronary Artery Disease ( 1.2 ) o Chronic Stable Angina o Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal’s or Variant Angina) o Angiographically Documented Coronary Artery Disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40% 1.1 Hypertension NORVASC ® is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including NORVASC. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. NORVASC may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina NORVASC is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. NORVASC may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal’s or Variant Angina) NORVASC is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. NORVASC may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, NORVASC is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.","10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly a reflex tachycardia. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of NORVASC is limited. Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine/kg and 100 mg amlodipine/kg in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As NORVASC is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit.",Viatris Specialty LLC,AMLODIPINE BESYLATE

Note: Some patients may achieve better responses with unequal nightly doses at bedtime and 2.5 to 4 hours later. 2.3 Dosing Information in Adult Patients with Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH) The dosage and regimen of XYWAV should be individualized based on clinical presentation [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . XYWAV can be administered as a twice nightly or once nightly regimen. The recommended starting dose, titration guidance, and maximum nightly doses appear in Table 3: Table 3: Recommended Nightly Dosage in Adult Patients with IH Dosing Regimen Starting Nightly Dose Titration Increments Maximum Total Nightly Dose Twice nightly *,† ≤4.5 g per night divided into two doses (e.g., 2.25 g each) ≤1.5 g per night per week (divided into two doses) 9 g (divided into two doses) Once nightly ≤3 g per night ≤1.5 g per night per week 6 g * Some patients may achieve better responses with unequal nightly doses at bedtime and 2.5 to 4 hours later. † The first dose should be taken at bedtime and the second dose taken 2.5 to 4 hours later. The increase in the total nightly dose should not exceed 1.5 g /week. During titration, the dosing regimen may be changed between twice nightly and once nightly, as needed based on efficacy and tolerability [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . Doses higher than 9 g per night or single dose administrations higher than 6 g have not been studied and should not be administered. 2.4 Important Administration Instructions for All Patients Administer XYWAV at least 2 hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Prepare all doses of XYWAV prior to bedtime. Prior to ingestion, each dose of XYWAV should be diluted with approximately ¼ cup (approximately 60 mL) of water in the empty pharmacy-provided containers. Solutions prepared following dilution should be consumed within 24 hours. Patients should take each dose of XYWAV while in bed and lie down immediately after dosing, and remain in bed following ingestion of each dose. XYWAV may cause patients to fall asleep abruptly without first feeling drowsy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Patients will often fall asleep within 5 minutes of taking XYWAV, and will usually fall asleep within 15 minutes, though the time it takes any individual patient to fall asleep may vary from night to night. If dosing twice nightly, patients may need to set an alarm to awaken for the second dose. If the second dose is missed, that dose should be skipped and XYWAV should not be taken again until the next night. Two XYWAV doses should never be taken at one time. 2.5 Patients Transitioning from Xyrem to XYWAV On the first night of dosing with XYWAV, initiate treatment at the same dose (gram for gram) and regimen as Xyrem. Titrate as needed based on efficacy and tolerability [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 2.6 Dosage Modification in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended starting dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is one-half of the original dosage per night administered orally, divided into two doses [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.7 Dosage Adjustment with Co-administration of Divalproex Sodium When initiating divalproex sodium in patients taking a stable dosage of XYWAV, a reduction of the XYWAV dosage by at least 20% is recommended with initial concomitant use [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . When initiating XYWAV in patients already taking divalproex sodium, a lower starting dosage of XYWAV is recommended. Subsequently, the dosage of XYWAV can be adjusted based on individual clinical response and tolerability.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE XYWAV is a central nervous system depressant indicated for the treatment of: • Cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy ( 1.1 ). • Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH) in adults ( 1.2 ). 1.1 Narcolepsy XYWAV is indicated for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. 1.2 Idiopathic Hypersomnia XYWAV is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in adults.,"10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience Information regarding overdose with XYWAV is derived largely from reports in the medical literature that describe symptoms and signs in individuals who have ingested GHB illicitly. In these circumstances the co-ingestion of other drugs and alcohol was common, and may have influenced the presentation and severity of clinical manifestations of overdose. In adult clinical trials with Xyrem (same active moiety as XYWAV), two cases of overdose were reported. In the first case, an estimated dose of 150 g, more than 15 times the maximum recommended dose, caused a patient to be unresponsive with brief periods of apnea and to be incontinent of urine and feces. This individual recovered without sequelae. In the second case, death was reported following a multiple drug overdose consisting of Xyrem and numerous other drugs. No cases of overdose (greater than 9 g) with XYWAV were reported in the XYWAV clinical trials. 10.2 Signs and Symptoms Information about signs and symptoms associated with overdosage with XYWAV derives from reports of illicit use of GHB. Patient presentation following overdose is influenced by the dose ingested, the time since ingestion, the co-ingestion of other drugs and alcohol, and the fed or fasted state. Patients have exhibited varying degrees of depressed consciousness that may fluctuate rapidly between a confusional, agitated combative state with ataxia and coma. Emesis (even when obtunded), diaphoresis, headache, and impaired psychomotor skills have been observed. No typical pupillary changes have been described to assist in diagnosis; pupillary reactivity to light is maintained. Blurred vision has been reported. An increasing depth of coma and acidosis have been observed at higher doses. Myoclonus and tonic-clonic seizures have been reported. Respiration may be unaffected or compromised in rate and depth. Cheyne-Stokes respiration and apnea have been observed. Bradycardia and hypothermia may accompany unconsciousness, as well as muscular hypotonia, but tendon reflexes remain intact. 10.3 Recommended Treatment of Overdose General symptomatic and supportive care should be instituted immediately, and gastric decontamination may be considered if co-ingestants are suspected. Because emesis may occur in the presence of obtundation, appropriate posture (left lateral recumbent position) and protection of the airway by intubation may be warranted. Although the gag reflex may be absent in deeply comatose patients, even unconscious patients may become combative to intubation, and rapid-sequence induction (without the use of sedative) should be considered. Vital signs and consciousness should be closely monitored. The bradycardia reported with GHB overdose has been responsive to atropine intravenous administration. No reversal of the central depressant effects of XYWAV can be expected from naloxone or flumazenil administration. The use of hemodialysis and other forms of extracorporeal drug removal have not been studied in GHB overdose, but have been reported in cases of acidosis associated with GHB ingestions of 125 g or greater; however, due to the rapid metabolism of oxybate, these measures may not be warranted. 10.4 Poison Control Center As with the management of all cases of drug overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The healthcare provider is encouraged to collect urine and blood samples for routine toxicologic screening, and to consult with a regional poison control center (1-800-222-1222) for current treatment recommendations.","Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, POTASSIUM, AND SODIUM OXYBATES"

Doses higher than 9 g per night or single dose administrations higher than 6 g have not been studied and should not be administered. 2.4 Important Administration Instructions for All Patients Administer XYWAV at least 2 hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Prepare all doses of XYWAV prior to bedtime. Prior to ingestion, each dose of XYWAV should be diluted with approximately ¼ cup (approximately 60 mL) of water in the empty pharmacy-provided containers. Solutions prepared following dilution should be consumed within 24 hours. Patients should take each dose of XYWAV while in bed and lie down immediately after dosing, and remain in bed following ingestion of each dose. XYWAV may cause patients to fall asleep abruptly without first feeling drowsy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Patients will often fall asleep within 5 minutes of taking XYWAV, and will usually fall asleep within 15 minutes, though the time it takes any individual patient to fall asleep may vary from night to night. If dosing twice nightly, patients may need to set an alarm to awaken for the second dose. If the second dose is missed, that dose should be skipped and XYWAV should not be taken again until the next night. Two XYWAV doses should never be taken at one time. 2.5 Patients Transitioning from Xyrem to XYWAV On the first night of dosing with XYWAV, initiate treatment at the same dose (gram for gram) and regimen as Xyrem. Titrate as needed based on efficacy and tolerability [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . 2.6 Dosage Modification in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended starting dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is one-half of the original dosage per night administered orally, divided into two doses [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.7 Dosage Adjustment with Co-administration of Divalproex Sodium When initiating divalproex sodium in patients taking a stable dosage of XYWAV, a reduction of the XYWAV dosage by at least 20% is recommended with initial concomitant use [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . When initiating XYWAV in patients already taking divalproex sodium, a lower starting dosage of XYWAV is recommended. Subsequently, the dosage of XYWAV can be adjusted based on individual clinical response and tolerability.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE XYWAV is a central nervous system depressant indicated for the treatment of: • Cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy ( 1.1 ). • Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH) in adults ( 1.2 ). 1.1 Narcolepsy XYWAV is indicated for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. 1.2 Idiopathic Hypersomnia XYWAV is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in adults.,"10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience Information regarding overdose with XYWAV is derived largely from reports in the medical literature that describe symptoms and signs in individuals who have ingested GHB illicitly. In these circumstances the co-ingestion of other drugs and alcohol was common, and may have influenced the presentation and severity of clinical manifestations of overdose. In adult clinical trials with Xyrem (same active moiety as XYWAV), two cases of overdose were reported. In the first case, an estimated dose of 150 g, more than 15 times the maximum recommended dose, caused a patient to be unresponsive with brief periods of apnea and to be incontinent of urine and feces. This individual recovered without sequelae. In the second case, death was reported following a multiple drug overdose consisting of Xyrem and numerous other drugs. No cases of overdose (greater than 9 g) with XYWAV were reported in the XYWAV clinical trials. 10.2 Signs and Symptoms Information about signs and symptoms associated with overdosage with XYWAV derives from reports of illicit use of GHB. Patient presentation following overdose is influenced by the dose ingested, the time since ingestion, the co-ingestion of other drugs and alcohol, and the fed or fasted state. Patients have exhibited varying degrees of depressed consciousness that may fluctuate rapidly between a confusional, agitated combative state with ataxia and coma. Emesis (even when obtunded), diaphoresis, headache, and impaired psychomotor skills have been observed. No typical pupillary changes have been described to assist in diagnosis; pupillary reactivity to light is maintained. Blurred vision has been reported. An increasing depth of coma and acidosis have been observed at higher doses. Myoclonus and tonic-clonic seizures have been reported. Respiration may be unaffected or compromised in rate and depth. Cheyne-Stokes respiration and apnea have been observed. Bradycardia and hypothermia may accompany unconsciousness, as well as muscular hypotonia, but tendon reflexes remain intact. 10.3 Recommended Treatment of Overdose General symptomatic and supportive care should be instituted immediately, and gastric decontamination may be considered if co-ingestants are suspected. Because emesis may occur in the presence of obtundation, appropriate posture (left lateral recumbent position) and protection of the airway by intubation may be warranted. Although the gag reflex may be absent in deeply comatose patients, even unconscious patients may become combative to intubation, and rapid-sequence induction (without the use of sedative) should be considered. Vital signs and consciousness should be closely monitored. The bradycardia reported with GHB overdose has been responsive to atropine intravenous administration. No reversal of the central depressant effects of XYWAV can be expected from naloxone or flumazenil administration. The use of hemodialysis and other forms of extracorporeal drug removal have not been studied in GHB overdose, but have been reported in cases of acidosis associated with GHB ingestions of 125 g or greater; however, due to the rapid metabolism of oxybate, these measures may not be warranted. 10.4 Poison Control Center As with the management of all cases of drug overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The healthcare provider is encouraged to collect urine and blood samples for routine toxicologic screening, and to consult with a regional poison control center (1-800-222-1222) for current treatment recommendations.","Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, POTASSIUM, AND SODIUM OXYBATES"

COENZYME Q10,N/A,N/A,Hospitalisation,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Considerations Dosage of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg glipizide/2000 mg metformin. Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely due to glipizide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of blood glucose for the individual patient. With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA 1c should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA 1c to normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA 1c , which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone. No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablet therapy in patients taking concomitant glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring. When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam. Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise Alone For patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 2.5 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. For patients whose FPG is 280 mg/dL to 320 mg/dL a starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, 2.5 mg/500 mg twice daily should be considered. The efficacy of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients whose FPG exceeds 320 mg/dL has not been established. Dosage increases to achieve adequate glycemic control should be made in increments of 1 tablet per day every 2 weeks up to maximum of 10 mg/1000 mg or 10 mg/2000 mg glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets per day given in divided doses. In clinical trials of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets as initial therapy, there was no experience with total daily doses > 10 mg/2000 mg per day. Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on a Sulfonylurea and/or Metformin For patients not adequately controlled on either glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin alone, the recommended starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg twice daily with the morning and evening meals. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not exceed the daily doses of glipizide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day. Patients previously treated with combination therapy of glipizide (or another sulfonylurea) plus metformin may be switched to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg; the starting dose should not exceed the daily dose of glipizide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin already being taken. The decision to switch to the nearest equivalent dose or to titrate should be based on clinical judgment. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose. Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and periodically thereafter. Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . Initiation of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 is not recommended. In patients taking glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy. Discontinue glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets if the patient’s eGFR later falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . (See WARNINGS .) Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedure Discontinue glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable. Specific Patient Populations Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use during pregnancy or for use in pediatric patients. The initial and maintenance dosing of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment requires a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .)",INDICATIONS AND USAGE Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets USP are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"OVERDOSAGE Glipizide Overdosage of sulfonylureas, including glipizide, can produce hypoglycemia. Mild hypoglycemic symptoms, without loss of consciousness or neurological findings, should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hypoglycemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently, but constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. If hypoglycemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given a rapid intravenous injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate that will maintain the blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/dL. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours, since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Clearance of glipizide from plasma would be prolonged in persons with liver disease. Because of the extensive protein binding of glipizide, dialysis is unlikely to be of benefit. Metformin Hydrochloride Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts > 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases (see WARNINGS ). Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.","Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",GLIPIZIDE AND METFORMIN HYDROCHLORIDE

FUROSEMIDE,N/A,N/A,Hospitalisation,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Edema Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response. Adults: The usual initial dose of furosemide tablets is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of furosemide tablets may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states. Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving furosemide tablets on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week. When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ). Geriatric Patients: In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ). Pediatric Patients: The usual initial dose of oral furosemide in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level. Hypertension Therapy should be individualized according to the patient's response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain the therapeutic response. Adults: The usual initial dose of furosemide tablets for hypertension is 80 mg, usually divided into 40 mg twice a day. Dosage should then be adjusted according to response. If response is not satisfactory, add other antihypertensive agents. Changes in blood pressure must be carefully monitored when furosemide tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, especially during initial therapy. To prevent excessive drop in blood pressure, the dosage of other agents should be reduced by at least 50 percent when furosemide tablets are added to the regimen. As the blood pressure falls under the potentiating effect of furosemide tablets, a further reduction in dosage or even discontinuation of other antihypertensive drugs may be necessary. Geriatric Patients: In general, dose selection and dose adjustment for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Edema Furosemide tablets are indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Furosemide tablets are particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired. Hypertension Oral furosemide may be used in adults for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Hypertensive patients who cannot be adequately controlled with thiazides will probably also not be adequately controlled with furosemide alone.","OVERDOSAGE The principal signs and symptoms of overdose with furosemide are dehydration, blood volume reduction, hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, hypokalemia and hypochloremic alkalosis, and are extensions of its diuretic action. The acute toxicity of furosemide has been determined in mice, rats and dogs. In all three, the oral LD 50 exceeded 1000 mg/kg body weight, while the intravenous LD 50 ranged from 300 to 680 mg/kg. The acute intragastric toxicity in neonatal rats is 7 to 10 times that of adult rats. The concentration of furosemide in biological fluids associated with toxicity or death is not known. Treatment of overdosage is supportive and consists of replacement of excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Serum electrolytes, carbon dioxide level and blood pressure should be determined frequently. Adequate drainage must be assured in patients with urinary bladder outlet obstruction (such as prostatic hypertrophy). Hemodialysis does not accelerate furosemide elimination.",Bryant Ranch Prepack,FUROSEMIDE

Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution should not be injected subconjunctivally, nor should it be introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye. There are rare reports of anaphylactic reaction/shock and fatal hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving systemic quinolones, some following the first dose, including ofloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, angioedema (including laryngeal, pharyngeal or facial edema), airway obstruction, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. A rare occurrence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which progressed to toxic epidermal necrolysis, has been reported in a patient who was receiving topical ophthalmic ofloxacin. If an allergic reaction to ofloxacin occurs, discontinue the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment. Oxygen and airway management, including intubation should be administered as clinically indicated.",N/A,N/A
PROBIOTIC COMPLEX,N/A,N/A,Hospitalisation,"DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Gabapentin tablets USP are given orally with or without food. Patients should be informed that, should they break the scored 600 or 800 mg tablet in order to administer a half-tablet, they should take the unused half-tablet as the next dose. Half-tablets not used within several days of breaking the scored tablet should be discarded. If gabapentin tablets USP dose is reduced, discontinued or substituted with an alternative medication, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week (a longer time period may be needed at the discretion of the prescriber). Postherpetic Neuralgia In adults with postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin therapy may be initiated as a single 300 mg dose on Day 1, 600 mg/day on Day 2 (divided BID), and 900 mg/day on Day 3 (divided TID). The dose can subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a daily dose of 1800 mg (divided TID). In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with comparable effects across the dose range. Additional benefit of using doses greater than 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated. Epilepsy Gabapentin tablets USP, are recommended for add-on therapy in patients 3 years of age and older. Effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years has not been established. Patients >12 years of age: The effective dose of gabapentin is 900 to 1800 mg/day and given in divided doses (three times a day) using 300 or 400 mg capsules, 600 or 800 mg tablets. The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. If necessary, the dose may be increased using 300 or 400 mg capsules, 600 or 800 mg tablets three times a day up to 1800 mg/day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies. Doses of 3600 mg/day have also been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short duration, and have been well tolerated. The maximum time between doses in the TID schedule should not exceed 12 hours. Pediatric Patients Age 3 to 12 years: The starting dose should range from 10 to 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses, and the effective dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days. The effective dose of gabapentin in patients 5 years of age and older is 25 to 35 mg/kg/day and given in divided doses (three times a day). The effective dose in pediatric patients ages 3 and 4 years is 40 mg/kg/day and given in divided doses (three times a day) (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pediatrics ). Gabapentin may be administered as the oral solution, capsule, or tablet, or using combinations of these formulations. Dosages up to 50 mg/kg/day have been well tolerated in a long-term clinical study. The maximum time interval between doses should not exceed 12 hours. It is not necessary to monitor gabapentin plasma concentrations to optimize gabapentin therapy. Further, because there are no significant pharmacokinetic interactions among gabapentin and other commonly used antiepileptic drugs, the addition of gabapentin does not alter the plasma levels of these drugs appreciably. If gabapentin tablets are discontinued and/or an alternate anticonvulsant medication is added to the therapy, this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week. Dosage in Renal Impairment Creatinine clearance is difficult to measure in outpatients. In patients with stable renal function, creatinine clearance (C Cr ) can be reasonably well estimated using the equation of Cockcroft and Gault: for females C Cr =(0.85)(140-age)(weight)/[(72)(S Cr )] for males C Cr =(140-age)(weight)/[(72)(S Cr )] where age is in years, weight is in kilograms and S Cr is serum creatinine in mg/dL. Dosage adjustment in patients ≥12 years of age with compromised renal function or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended as follows (see dosing recommendations above for effective doses in each indication).

BELSOMRA,N/A,N/A,Hospitalisation,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest dose effective for the patient ( 2.1 ). Recommended dose is 10 mg, no more than once per night taken within 30 minutes of going to bed, with at least 7 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 10 mg dose is well-tolerated but not effective, the dose can be increased, not to exceed 20 mg once daily ( 2.1 , 2.2 ). Time to effect may be delayed if taken with or soon after a meal ( 2.1 ). 2.1 Dosing Information Use the lowest dose effective for the patient. For all BELSOMRA doses, take no more than once per night within 30 minutes of going to bed (with at least 7 hours remaining prior to planned awakening). Time to effect of BELSOMRA may be delayed if taken with or soon after a meal [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The recommended dose for BELSOMRA is 10 mg, taken no more than once per night. If the 10 mg dose is well-tolerated but not effective, the dose can be increased. The maximum recommended dose of BELSOMRA is 20 mg taken no more than once per night. 2.2 Special Populations Exposure to BELSOMRA is increased in obese compared to non-obese patients, and in women compared to men. Particularly in obese women, the increased risk of exposure-related adverse effects should be considered before increasing the dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.3 Use with CNS Depressants When BELSOMRA is combined with other CNS depressant drugs, dosage reduction of BELSOMRA and/or the other drug(s) may be necessary because of potentially additive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.4 Dosage Adjustments with CYP3A Inhibitors When used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the recommended dosage of BELSOMRA is 5 mg taken no more than once per night (the dose generally should not exceed 10 mg). BELSOMRA is not recommended for use with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] .","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BELSOMRA ® (suvorexant) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. BELSOMRA is an orexin receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance ( 1 ).","10 OVERDOSAGE There is limited premarketing clinical experience with an overdosage of BELSOMRA. In clinical pharmacology studies, healthy subjects who were administered morning doses of up to 240 mg of suvorexant showed dose-dependent increases in the frequency and duration of somnolence. General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used, along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. As in all cases of drug overdose, vital signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined. As suvorexant is highly protein-bound, hemodialysis is not expected to contribute to elimination of suvorexant. As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. Consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage.",Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC,SUVOREXANT
KETAMINE,N/A,N/A,Hospitalisation,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • See Full Prescribing Information for important dosage and administration instructions. ( 2 ) • Induction of Anesthesia : -- Intravenous Route : Initially, 1 to 4.5 mg/kg administered slowly (over a period of 60 seconds). Alternatively, administer a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min. ( 2.2 ) -- Intramuscular Route : Initially, 6.5 to 13 mg/kg. ( 2.2 ) • Maintenance of Anesthesia : Increments of one-half to the full induction dose may be repeated as needed ( 2.2 ). Adjust the dose according to the patient's anesthetic needs and whether an additional anesthetic agent is employed. ( 2.2 ) • Supplement to Other Anesthetic Agents : The regimen of a reduced dose of Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection supplemented with diazepam can be used to produce balanced anesthesia by combination with other agents. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection should be administered by or under the direction of physicians experienced in the administration of general anesthetics, maintenance of a patent airway, and oxygenation and ventilation. Continuously monitor vital signs in patients receiving Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection. Emergency airway equipment must be immediately available. Do not administer the 100 mg/mL concentration of Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection intravenously without proper dilution [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Must be used immediately after dilution. While some degree of airway protection may be afforded due to active laryngeal-pharyngeal reflexes, vomiting and aspiration may occur with ketamine. Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for use in patients who have not followed nil per os guidelines. Due to the potential for salivation during Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection administration, administer an antisialagogue prior to induction of anesthesia. In individuals with a history of chronic ketamine use for off-label indications, there have been case reports of genitourinary pain that may be related to the ketamine treatment, not the underlying condition [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Consider cessation of ketamine if genitourinary pain continues in the setting of other genitourinary symptoms. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration The Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection dosage must be individualized and titrated to the desired clinical effect. If a longer duration of effect is desired, additional increments can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly to maintain anesthesia. However, a higher total dose will result in a longer time to complete recovery. Induction of Anesthesia Intravenous Route: The initial dose of Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection administered intravenously may range from 1 mg/kg to 4.5 mg/kg. The average amount required to produce 5 to 10 minutes of surgical anesthesia within 30 seconds following injection is 2 mg/kg. Administer Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection slowly (i.e., over a period of 60 seconds). Rapid administration may result in respiratory depression and enhanced vasopressor response. The induction dose may be administered as an intravenous infusion at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min. Intramuscular Route: The initial dose of Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection administered intramuscularly may range from 6.5 to 13 mg/kg. A dose of 9 to 13 mg/kg usually produces surgical anesthesia within 3 to 4 minutes following injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting 12 to 25 minutes. Administer a benzodiazepine, if clinically indicated, for the prevention of neuropsychological manifestations during emergence from anesthesia. Maintenance of Anesthesia Adjust the maintenance dose according to the patient's anesthetic needs and whether an additional anesthetic agent is administered. Repeat increments of one-half to the full induction dose as needed for maintenance of anesthesia. Purposeless and tonic-clonic movements of extremities may occur during the course of ketamine anesthesia. These movements do not imply a light plane and are not indicative of the need for additional doses of the anesthetic. Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection given by slow microdrip infusion technique at a dose of 0.1 to 0.5 mg/minute will maintain general anesthesia in adult patients induced with ketamine. Augment Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection with an intravenous benzodiazepine for the prevention of neuropsychological manifestations during emergence. Supplement to Other Anesthetic Agents Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection can be administered to supplement other general and local anesthetic agents. Continuously monitor patients for changes in respiratory and hemodynamic parameters. A reduced dose of Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection can be used to produce balanced anesthesia when used in combination with other anesthetic agents. 2.3 Preparation of Dilution Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection is a clear, colorless sterile solution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard if product is discolored or contains particulate matter. Induction of Anesthesia : Do not intravenously inject the 100 mg/mL concentration of Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection without proper dilution. Dilute Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection with an equal volume of either Sterile Water for injection, USP, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (Normal Saline), or 5% Dextrose in Water. Use immediately after dilution. Maintenance of Anesthesia : To prepare a dilute solution containing 1 mg of ketamine per mL, aseptically transfer 10 mL from a 50 mg per mL vial or 5 mL from a 100 mg per mL vial to 500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (Normal Saline) and mix well. The resultant solution will contain 1 mg of ketamine per mL. Use immediately after dilution. When fluid restriction is required, Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection can be added to a 250 mL infusion as described above to provide a Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection concentration of 2 mg/mL.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketamine Hydrochloride Injection is indicated: • as the sole anesthetic agent for diagnostic and surgical procedures that do not require skeletal muscle relaxation. • for the induction of anesthesia prior to the administration of other general anesthetic agents. • as a supplement to other anesthetic agents.

PYRAZINAMIDE,36,801,Pericardial effusion,"DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Pyrazinamide should always be administered with other effective antituberculous drugs. It is administered for the initial 2 months of a 6-month or longer treatment regimen for drug-susceptible patients. Patients who are known or suspected to have drug-resistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy. Patients with concomitant HIV infection may require longer courses of therapy. Physicians treating such patients should be alert to any revised recommendations from CDC for this group of patients. Usual dose: Pyrazinamide is administered orally, 15 to 30 mg/kg once daily. Older regimens employed 3 to 4 divided doses daily, but most current recommendations are for once a day. Three grams per day should not be exceeded. The CDC recommendations do not exceed 2 g per day when given as a daily regimen (see table). Alternatively, a twice weekly dosing regimen (50 to 70 mg/kg twice weekly based on lean body weight) has been developed to promote patient compliance with a regimen on an outpatient basis. In studies evaluating the twice weekly regimen, doses of pyrazinamide in excess of 3 g twice weekly have been administered. This exceeds the recommended maximum 3 g/daily dose. However, an increased incidence of adverse reactions has not been reported.

(The current recommendation of the CDC for drug-susceptible disease is to use a six-month regimen for initial treatment of active tuberculosis, consisting of isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide given for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months. *4 ) (Patients with drug-resistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy.) (In patients with concomitant HIV infection, the physician should be aware of current recommendations of CDC. It is possible these patients may require a longer course of treatment.) It is also indicated after treatment failure with other primary drugs in any form of active tuberculosis. Pyrazinamide should only be used in conjunction with other effective antituberculous agents. *See recommendations of Center for Disease Control (CDC) and American Thoracic Society for complete regimen and dosage recommendations. 4","OVERDOSAGE Overdosage experience is limited. In one case report of overdose, abnormal liver function tests developed. These spontaneously reverted to normal when the drug was stopped. Clinical monitoring and supportive therapy should be employed. Pyrazinamide is dialyzable. 13",Novitium Pharma LLC,PYRAZINAMIDE
RIFAMPIN,36,801,Pericardial effusion,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Rifampin can be administered by the oral route (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for dosing information in patients with renal failure. Tuberculosis Adults 10 mg/kg, in a single daily administration, not to exceed 600 mg/day, orally. Pediatric Patients 10 to 20 mg/kg, not to exceed 600 mg/day, orally. It is recommended that oral rifampin be administered once daily, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water. Rifampin is indicated in the treatment of all forms of tuberculosis. A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, the American Thoracic Society, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of tuberculosis unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered. Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with rifampin and isoniazid for at least 4 months. Treatment should be continued for longer if the patient is still sputum or culture positive, if resistant organisms are present, or if the patient is HIV positive. Meningococcal Carriers Adults For adults, it is recommended that 600 mg rifampin be administered twice daily for two days. Pediatric Patients Pediatric patients 1 month of age or older: 10 mg/kg (not to exceed 600 mg per dose) every 12 hours for two days. Pediatric Patients Under 1 Month of Age 5 mg/kg every 12 hours for two days. Preparation of Extemporaneous Oral Suspension For pediatric and adult patients in whom capsule swallowing is difficult or where lower doses are needed, a liquid suspension may be prepared as follows: Rifampin 1% w/v suspension (10 mg/mL) can be compounded using one of four syrups-Simple Syrup (Syrup NF), Simple Syrup (Humco Laboratories), SyrPalta® Syrup (Emerson Laboratories), or Raspberry Syrup (Humco Laboratories). 1. Empty the contents of four Rifampin 300 mg capsules or eight Rifampin 150 mg capsules onto a piece of weighing paper. 2. If necessary, gently crush the capsule contents with a spatula to product a fine powder. 3. Transfer the rifampin powder blend to a 4-ounce amber glass or plastic (high density polyethylene [HDPE], polypropylene, or polycarbonate) prescription bottle. 4. Rinse the paper and spatula with 20 mL of one of the above mentioned syrups, and add the rinse to the bottle. Shake vigorously. 5. Add 100 mL of syrup to the bottle and shake vigorously. This compounding procedure results in a 1% w/v suspension containing 10 mg rifampin/mL. Stability studies indicate that the suspension is stable when stored at room temperature (25±3° C) or in a refrigerator (2 to 8° C) for four weeks. This extemporaneously prepared suspension must be shaken well prior to administration.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE In the treatment of both tuberculosis and the meningococcal carrier state, the small number of resistant cells present within large populations of susceptible cells can rapidly become the predominant type. Bacteriologic cultures should be obtained before the start of therapy to confirm the susceptibility of the organism to rifampin and they should be repeated throughout therapy to monitor the response to treatment. Since resistance can emerge rapidly, susceptibility tests should be performed in the event of persistent positive cultures during the course of treatment. If test results show resistance to rifampin and the patient is not responding to therapy, the drug regimen should be modified. Tuberculosis Rifampin is indicated in the treatment of all forms of tuberculosis. A three-drug regimen consisting of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide (e.g., RIFATER ® (Sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC)) is recommended in the initial phase of short-course therapy which is usually continued for 2 months. The Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, the American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that either streptomycin or ethambutol be added as a fourth drug in a regimen containing isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and pyrazinamide for initial treatment of tuberculosis unless the likelihood of INH resistance is very low. The need for a fourth drug should be reassessed when the results of susceptibility testing are known. If community rates of INH resistance are currently less than 4%, an initial treatment regimen with less than four drugs may be considered. Following the initial phase, treatment should be continued with rifampin and isoniazid for at least 4 months. Treatment should be continued for longer if the patient is still sputum or culture positive, if resistant organisms are present, or if the patient is HIV positive. Rifampin IV is indicated for the initial treatment and retreatment of tuberculosis when the drug cannot be taken by mouth. Meningococcal Carriers Rifampin is indicated for the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. Rifampin is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection because of the possibility of the rapid emergence of resistant organisms. (See WARNINGS .) Rifampin should not be used indiscriminately, and, therefore, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed for establishment of the carrier state and the correct treatment. So that the usefulness of rifampin in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers is preserved, the drug should be used only when the risk of meningococcal disease is high. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of rifampin and other antibacterial drugs, rifampin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.","OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pruritus, headache, and increasing lethargy will probably occur within a short time after ingestion; unconsciousness may occur when there is severe hepatic disease. Transient increases in liver enzymes and/or bilirubin may occur. Brownishred or orange discoloration of the skin, urine, sweat, saliva, tears, and feces will occur, and its intensity is proportional to the amount ingested. Liver enlargement, possibly with tenderness, can develop within a few hours after severe overdosage; bilirubin levels may increase and jaundice may develop rapidly. Hepatic involvement may be more marked in patients with prior impairment of hepatic function. Other physical findings remain essentially normal. A direct effect upon the hematopoietic system, electrolyte levels, or acid-base balance is unlikely. Facial or periorbital edema has also been reported in pediatric patients. Hypotension, sinus tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, seizures, and cardiac arrest were reported in some fatal cases. Acute Toxicity The minimum acute lethal or toxic dose is not well established. However, nonfatal acute overdoses in adults have been reported with doses ranging from 9 to 12 gm rifampin. Fatal acute overdoses in adults have been reported with doses ranging from 14 to 60 gm. Alcohol or a history of alcohol abuse was involved in some of the fatal and nonfatal reports. Nonfatal overdoses in pediatric patients ages 1 to 4 years old of 100 mg/kg for one to two doses has been reported. Treatment Intensive support measures should be instituted and individual symptoms treated as they arise. The airway should be secured and adequate respiratory exchange established. Since nausea and vomiting are likely to be present, gastric lavage within the first 2 to 3 hours after ingestion is probably preferable to induction of emesis. Following evacuation of the gastric contents, the instillation of activated charcoal slurry into the stomach may help absorb any remaining drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Antiemetic medication may be required to control severe nausea and vomiting. Active diuresis (with measured intake and output) will help promote excretion of the drug. For severe cases, extracorporeal hemodialysis may be required. If this is not available, peritoneal dialysis can be used along with forced diuresis.","EPIC PHARMA, LLC",RIFAMPIN
ISONIAZID,36,801,Pericardial effusion,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (See also INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) NOTE For preventive therapy of tuberculous infection and treatment of tuberculosis, it is recommended that physicians be familiar with the following publications: (1) the recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, published in the MMWR: vol 42; RR-4, 1993 and (2) Treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine: vol 149; 1359-1374, 1994. For Treatment of Tuberculosis Isoniazid is used in conjunction with other effective anti-tuberculous agents. Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organisms initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible. Usual Oral Dosage (depending on the regimen used): Adults 5 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 15 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times/week Children 10 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 20 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times/week Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Without HIV Infection There are 3 regimen options for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in children and adults: Option 1 Daily isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 16 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin daily or 2 to 3 times weekly. Ethambutol or streptomycin should be added to the initial regimen until sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin is demonstrated. The addition of a fourth drug is optional if the relative prevalence of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the community is less than or equal to four percent. Option 2 Daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin or ethambutol for 2 weeks followed by twice weekly administration of the same drugs for 6 weeks, subsequently twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin for 16 weeks. Option 3 Three times weekly with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol or streptomycin for 6 months. * All regimens given twice weekly or 3 times weekly should be administered by directly observed therapy [see also Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)] . The above treatment guidelines apply only when the disease is caused by organisms that are susceptible to the standard antituberculous agents. Because of the impact of resistance to isoniazid and rifampin on the response to therapy, it is essential that physicians initiating therapy for tuberculosis be familiar with the prevalence of drug resistance in their communities. It is suggested that ethambutol not be used in children whose visual acuity cannot be monitored. Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis and HIV Infection The response of the immunologically impaired host to treatment may not be as satisfactory as that of a person with normal host responsiveness. For this reason, therapeutic decisions for the impaired host must be individualized. Since patients co-infected with HIV may have problems with malabsorption, screening of antimycobacterial drug levels, especially in patients with advanced HIV disease, may be necessary to prevent the emergence of MDRTB. Patients with Extra Pulmonary Tuberculosis The basic principles that underlie the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis also apply to Extra pulmonary forms of the disease. Although there have not been the same kinds of carefully conducted controlled trials of treatment of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis as for pulmonary disease, increasing clinical experience indicates that a 6 to 9 month short-course regimen is effective. Because of the insufficient data, miliary tuberculosis, bone/joint tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis in infants and children should receive 12 month therapy. Bacteriologic evaluation of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis may be limited by the relative inaccessibility of the sites of disease. Thus, response to treatment often must be judged on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings. The use of adjunctive therapies such as surgery and corticosteroids is more commonly required in Extra pulmonary tuberculosis than in pulmonary disease. Surgery may be necessary to obtain specimens for diagnosis and to treat such processes as constrictive pericarditis and spinal cord compression from Pott's Disease. Corticosteriods have been shown to be of benefit in preventing cardiac constriction from tuberculous pericarditis and in decreasing the neurologic sequelae of all stages of tuberculosis meningitis, especially when administered early in the course of the disease. Pregnant Women with Tuberculosis The options listed above must be adjusted for the pregnant patient. Streptomycin interferes with in utero development of the ear and may cause congenital deafness. Routine use of pyrazinamide is also not recommended in pregnancy because of inadequate teratogenicity data. The initial treatment regimen should consist of isoniazid and rifampin. Ethambutol should be included unless primary isoniazid resistance is unlikely (isoniazid resistance rate documented to be less than 4%). Treatment of Patients with Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) Multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis (i.e., resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) presents difficult treatment problems. Treatment must be individualized and based on susceptibility studies. In such cases, consultation with an expert in tuberculosis is recommended. Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) A major cause of drug-resistant tuberculosis is patient noncompliance with treatment. The use of DOT can help assure patient compliance with drug therapy. DOT is the observation of the patient by a health care provider or other responsible person as the patient ingests anti-tuberculosis medications. DOT can be achieved with daily, twice weekly or thrice weekly regimens and is recommended for all patients. For Preventative Therapy of Tuberculosis Before isoniazid preventive therapy is initiated, bacteriologically positive or radiographically progressive tuberculosis must be excluded. Appropriate evaluations should be performed if Extra pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected. Adults over 30 kg: 300 mg per day in a single dose. Infants and Children: 10 mg/kg (up to 300 mg daily) in a single dose. In situations where adherence with daily preventative therapy cannot be assured, 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg (not to exceed 900 mg) twice weekly under the direct observation of a health care worker at the time of administration 8 . Continuous administration of isoniazid for a sufficient period is an essential part of the regimen because relapse rates are higher if chemotherapy is stopped prematurely. In the treatment of tuberculosis, resistant organisms may multiply and the emergence of resistant organisms during the treatment may necessitate a change in the regimen. For following patient compliance: the Potts-Cozart test 9 , a simple colorimetric 6 method of checking for isoniazid in the urine, is a useful tool for assuring patient compliance, which is essential for effective tuberculosis control. Additionally, isoniazid test strips are also available to check patient compliance. Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B 6 ) is recommended in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuropathy (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics).","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Isoniazid Tablets are recommended for all forms of tuberculosis in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant anti-tuberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Single-drug treatment of active tuberculosis with isoniazid or any other medication, is inadequate therapy. Isoniazid Tablets are recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note: the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis): Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (greater than or equal to 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin-negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy. Close contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). In addition, tuberculin-negative (less than 5 mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of infectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive (greater than 5 mm), therapy should be continued. Recent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test (greater than or equal to 10 mm increase within a 2-year period for those less than 35 years old; greater than or equal to 15 mm increase for those greater than or equal to 35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a greater than 10 mm skin test are included in this category. Persons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. Intravenous drug users known to be HIV-seronegative (greater than 10 mm). Persons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 10 mm): silicosis; diabetes mellitus; prolonged therapy with adrenocorticosteroids; immunosuppressive therapy; some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkin's disease; end-stage renal disease; clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic undernutrition (including: intestinal bypass surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state [with or without weight loss], chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. Additionally, in the absence of any of the above risk factors, persons under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are also appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they are a member of any of the following high-incidence groups: Foreign-born persons from high-prevalence countries who never received BCG vaccine. Medically underserved low-income populations, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans. Residents of facilities for long-term care (e.g., correctional institutions, nursing homes and mental institutions). Children who are less than 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have greater than 10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test. Finally, persons under the age of 35 who a) have none of the above risk factors (1 to 6); b) belong to none of the high-incidence groups; and c) have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more, are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy. The risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactors over the age of 35. However, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above (1 to 6) and on an individual basis in situations where there is likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected.","OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms Isoniazid overdosage produces signs and symptoms within 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, slurring of speech, blurring of vision and visual hallucinations (including bright colors and strange designs) are among the early manifestations. With marked overdosage, respiratory distress and CNS depression, progressing rapidly from stupor to profound coma, are to be expected, along with severe, intractable seizures. Severe metabolic acidosis, acetonuria and hyperglycemia are typical laboratory findings. Treatment Untreated or inadequately treated cases of gross isoniazid overdosage, 80 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg, can cause neurotoxicity 6 and terminate fatally, but good response has been reported in most patients brought under adequate treatment within the first few hours after drug ingestion. For the Asymptomatic Patient Absorption of drugs from the GI tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal. Gastric emptying should also be employed in the asymptomatic patient. Safeguard the patient's airway when employing these procedures. Patients who acutely ingest greater than 80 mg/kg should be treated with intravenous pyridoxine on a gram per gram basis equal to the isoniazid dose. If an unknown amount of isoniazid is ingested, consider an initial dose of 5 grams of pyridoxine given over 30 to 60 minutes in adults or 80 mg/kg of pyridoxine in children. For the Symptomatic Patient Ensure adequate ventilation, support cardiac output and protect the airway while treating seizures and attempting to limit absorption. If the dose of isoniazid is known, the patient should be treated initially with a slow intravenous bolus of pyridoxine, over 3 to 5 minutes, on a gram per gram basis, equal to the isoniazid dose. If the quantity of isoniazid ingestion is unknown, then consider an initial intravenous bolus of pyridoxine of 5 grams in the adult or 80 mg/kg in the child. If seizures continue, the dosage of pyridoxine may be repeated. It would be rare that more than 10 grams of pyridoxine would need to be given. The maximum safe dose for pyridoxine in isoniazid intoxication is not known. If the patient does not respond to pyridoxine, diazepam may be administered. Phenytoin should be used cautiously, because isoniazid interferes with the metabolism of phenytoin. General Obtain blood samples for immediate determination of gases, electrolytes, BUN, glucose, etc.; type and cross-match blood in preparation for possible hemodialysis. Rapid Control of Metabolic Acidosis Patients with this degree of INH intoxication are likely to have hypoventilation. The administration of sodium bicarbonate under these circumstances can cause exacerbation of hypercarbia. Ventilation must be monitored carefully, by measuring blood carbon dioxide levels and supported mechanically, if there is respiratory insufficiency. Dialysis Both peritoneal and hemodialysis have been used in the management of isoniazid overdosage. These procedures are probably not required if control of seizures and acidosis is achieved with pyridoxine, diazepam and bicarbonate. Along with measures based on initial and repeated determination of blood gases and other laboratory tests as needed, utilize meticulous respiratory and other intensive care to protect against hypoxia, hypotension, aspiration, pneumonitis, etc.","Chartwell RX, LLC",ISONIAZID
ETHAMBUTOL,36,801,Pericardial effusion,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ethambutol hydrochloride should not be used alone, in initial treatment or in retreatment. Ethambutol hydrochloride should be administered on a once every 24-hour basis only. Absorption is not significantly altered by administration with food. Therapy, in general, should be continued until bacteriological conversion has become permanent and maximal clinical improvement has occurred. Ethambutol hydrochloride is not recommended for use in pediatric patients under 13 years of age since safe conditions for use have not been established. Initial Treatment In patients who have not received previous antituberculous therapy, administer ethambutol hydrochloride 15 mg/kg (7 mg/lb) of body weight, as a single oral dose once every 24 hours. In the more recent studies, isoniazid has been administered concurrently in a single, daily, oral dose. Retreatment In patients who have received previous antituberculous therapy, administer ethambutol hydrochloride 25 mg/kg (11 mg/lb) of body weight, as a single oral dose once every 24 hours. Concurrently administer at least one other antituberculous drug to which the organisms have been demonstrated to be susceptible by appropriate in vitro tests. Suitable drugs usually consist of those not previously used in the treatment of the patient. After 60 days of ethambutol hydrochloride administration, decrease the dose to 15 mg/kg (7 mg/lb) of body weight, and administer as a single oral dose once every 24 hours. During the period when a patient is on a daily dose of 25 mg/kg, monthly eye examinations are advised. See Table for easy selection of proper weight-dose tablet(s).

It should not be used as the sole antituberculous drug, but should be used in conjunction with at least one other antituberculous drug. Selection of the companion drug should be based on clinical experience, considerations of comparative safety, and appropriate in vitro susceptibility studies. In patients who have not received previous antituberculous therapy, i.e., initial treatment, the most frequently used regimens have been the following: Ethambutol hydrochloride, USP plus isoniazid Ethambutol hydrochloride, USP plus isoniazid plus streptomycin In patients who have received previous antituberculous therapy, mycobacterial resistance to other drugs used in initial therapy is frequent. Consequently, in such retreatment patients, ethambutol hydrochloride should be combined with at least one of the second line drugs not previously administered to the patient and to which bacterial susceptibility has been indicated by appropriate in vitro studies. Antituberculous drugs used with ethambutol hydrochloride have included cycloserine, ethionamide, pyrazinamide, viomycin and other drugs. Isoniazid, aminosalicylic acid, and streptomycin have also been used in multiple drug regimens. Alternating drug regimens have also been utilized.","WARNINGS Ethambutol hydrochloride may produce decreases in visual acuity which appear to be due to optic neuritis. This effect may be related to dose and duration of treatment. This effect is generally reversible when administration of the drug is discontinued promptly. However, irreversible blindness has been reported. (See PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Liver toxicities including fatalities have been reported (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ).

( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Two separate syringes (and two separate subcutaneous injections) are needed to administer the total dose of 210 mg of EVENITY. Inject two 105 mg/1.17 mL prefilled syringes, one after the other. EVENITY should be administered by a healthcare provider. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of EVENITY is 210 mg administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. Administer EVENITY once every month. The treatment duration for EVENITY is 12 monthly doses. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D during treatment with EVENITY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . If the EVENITY dose is missed, administer as soon as it can be rescheduled. Thereafter, EVENITY can be scheduled every month from the date of the last dose. 2.3 Preparation and Administration Instructions Step 1: Prior to Administration: Remove two syringes from the carton. Visually inspect EVENITY for particles and discoloration prior to administration. EVENITY is a clear to opalescent, colorless to light yellow solution. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or discolored or contains particles. Do not use the syringe if any part appears cracked or broken the gray needle cap is missing or not securely attached the expiration date printed on the label has passed the syringe has been dropped on a hard surface Always hold the prefilled syringe by the syringe barrel to remove the syringe from the tray. See Figure A . Do not grasp the plunger rod. Do not grasp the gray needle cap. Do not remove the gray needle cap until you are ready to inject. Allow EVENITY to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. Do not warm in any other way [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Figure A Step 2: Select the Injection Site and Prepare the Syringe Prepare and clean two injection sites, one for each of the two injections. See Figure B . Figure B The recommended subcutaneous injection sites include: The thigh Abdomen, except for a two-inch area right around the navel Outer area of upper arm Clean the injection sites with alcohol wipes. Let the skin dry. Choose a different site each time you give an injection. If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injection site you used for a previous injection. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. Choose the first syringe. Pull the gray needle cap straight off and away from your body when you are ready to inject. See Figure C . Figure C Do not put the gray needle cap back onto the syringe. Do not leave the cap off for more than 5 minutes as this can dry out the solution. The prefilled syringe may contain air bubbles. Do not try to push air bubbles out as it is normal to see air bubbles . Step 3: Inject EVENITY Insert needle and inject all the liquid subcutaneously. Do not administer into muscle or blood vessel. See Figure D . Figure D When done, gently lift the syringe off of the skin. Step 4: Syringe and Needle Cap Disposal Immediately dispose of the syringe and needle cap in the nearest sharps container.

CANCIDAS,58,801,Systemic candida,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Important Administration Instructions for All Patients ( 2.1 ): Administer by slow intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 1 hour. Do not administer by IV bolus administration. Do not mix or co-infuse CANCIDAS with other medications. Do not use diluents containing dextrose (α–D-glucose). Dosage in Adults [18 years of age and older] ( 2.2 ): Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily for all indications except esophageal candidiasis. For esophageal candidiasis, use 50 mg once daily with no loading dose. Dosage in Pediatric Patients [3 months to 17 years of age] ( 2.3 ): Dosing should be based on the patient's body surface area. For all indications, administer a single 70-mg/m 2 loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg/m 2 once daily thereafter. Maximum loading dose and daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg, regardless of the patient's calculated dose. Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment ( 2.4 ): Reduce dosage for adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (35 mg once daily, with a 70 mg loading dose on Day 1 where appropriate). Dosage Adjustment in Patients Receiving Concomitant Inducers of Hepatic CYP Enzymes ( 2.5 ): Use 70-mg once daily dose for adult patients on rifampin. Consider dose increase to 70 mg once daily for adult patients on nevirapine, efavirenz, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, or phenytoin. Pediatric patients receiving these same concomitant medications may also require an increase in dose to 70 mg/m 2 once daily (maximum daily dose not to exceed 70 mg). 2.1 Important Administration Instructions for Use in All Patients Administer CANCIDAS by slow intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 1 hour. Do not administer CANCIDAS by IV bolus administration. 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients [18 years of age and older] The dosage and duration of CANCIDAS treatment for each indication are as follows: Empirical Therapy for Presumed Fungal Infections in Febrile Neutropenic Patients Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be based on the patient's clinical response. Continue empirical therapy until resolution of neutropenia. In general, treat patients found to have a fungal infection for a minimum of 14 days after the last positive culture and continue treatment for at least 7 days after both neutropenia and clinical symptoms are resolved. If the 50-mg dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg. Candidemia and Other Candida Infections Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be dictated by the patient's clinical and microbiological response. In general, continue antifungal therapy for at least 14 days after the last positive culture. Patients with neutropenia who remain persistently neutropenic may warrant a longer course of therapy pending resolution of the neutropenia. Esophageal Candidiasis The dose is 50 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days after symptom resolution. A 70-mg loading dose has not been studied for this indication. Because of the risk of relapse of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with HIV infections, suppressive oral therapy could be considered [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Invasive Aspergillosis Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be based upon the severity of the patient's underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response. 2.3 Recommended Dosing in Pediatric Patients [3 months to 17 years of age] For all indications, administer a single 70 mg/m 2 loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg/m 2 once daily thereafter. The maximum loading dose and the daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg, regardless of the patient's calculated dose. Dosing in pediatric patients (3 months to 17 years of age) should be based on the patient's body surface area (BSA) as calculated by the Mosteller Formula [see References (15) ]: Following calculation of the patient's BSA, the loading dose in milligrams should be calculated as BSA (m 2 ) × 70 mg/m 2 . The maintenance dose in milligrams should be calculated as BSA (m 2 ) × 50 mg/m 2 . Duration of treatment should be individualized to the indication, as described for each indication in adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. If the 50-mg/m 2 daily dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg/m 2 daily (not to exceed 70 mg). Formula 2.4 Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) do not need a dosage adjustment. For adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), CANCIDAS 35 mg once daily is recommended based upon pharmacokinetic data [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] with a 70-mg loading dose administered on Day 1 where appropriate. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) and in pediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. 2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Patients Receiving Concomitant Inducers of Hepatic CYP Enzymes Adult Patients: Adult patients on rifampin should receive 70 mg of CANCIDAS once daily. When CANCIDAS is co-administered to adult patients with other inducers of hepatic CYP enzymes such as nevirapine, efavirenz, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, or phenytoin, administration of a daily dose of 70 mg of CANCIDAS should be considered [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Pediatric Patients: Pediatric patients on rifampin should receive 70 mg/m 2 of CANCIDAS daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg). When CANCIDAS is co-administered to pediatric patients with other inducers of hepatic CYP enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, a CANCIDAS dose of 70 mg/m 2 once daily (not to exceed 70 mg) should be considered [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 2.6 Preparation for Administration Reconstitution of CANCIDAS for Intravenous Infusion Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature. Aseptically add 10.8 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, Sterile Water for Injection, Bacteriostatic Water for Injection with methylparaben and propylparaben, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection with 0.9% benzyl alcohol to the vial. Each vial of CANCIDAS contains an intentional overfill of CANCIDAS. Thus, the volume of diluent to be added to each vial and the drug concentration of the resulting solution is listed in Table 1 below. Table 1: Information for Preparation of CANCIDAS CANCIDAS vial (equivalent to caspofungin) Volume of diluent to be added Reconstitution volume of diluent to be added is based on the overfill amount of caspofungin (54.6 mg and 75.6 mg, respectively). Resulting Concentration following Reconstitution 50 mg 10.8 mL 5 mg/mL 70 mg 10.8 mL 7 mg/mL The white to off-white cake will dissolve completely. Mix gently until a clear solution is obtained. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter or discoloration during reconstitution and prior to infusion. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or has precipitated. The reconstituted solution of CANCIDAS in the vial may be stored for up to one hour at ≤25°C (≤77°F) prior to the preparation of the infusion solution in the intravenous bag or bottle. CANCIDAS vials are for single-dose only. Discard unused portion. Dilution of the Reconstituted Solution in the Intravenous Bag for Infusion Aseptically transfer the appropriate volume (mL) of reconstituted CANCIDAS to an intravenous (IV) bag (or bottle) containing 250 mL of 0.9%, 0.45%, or 0.225% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers Injection. Alternatively, the volume (mL) of reconstituted CANCIDAS can be added to a reduced volume of 0.9%, 0.45%, or 0.225% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers Injection, not to exceed a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. This diluted infusion solution in the intravenous bag or bottle must be used within 24 hours if stored at ≤25°C (≤77°F) or within 48 hours if stored refrigerated at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F). Important Reconstitution and Dilution Instructions for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older Follow the reconstitution procedures described above using either the 70-mg or 50-mg vial to create the reconstituted solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . From the reconstituted solution in the vial, remove the volume of drug equal to the calculated loading dose or calculated maintenance dose based on a concentration of 7 mg/mL (if reconstituted from the 70-mg vial) or a concentration of 5 mg/mL (if reconstituted from the 50-mg vial). The choice of vial should be based on total milligram dose of drug to be administered to the pediatric patient. To help ensure accurate dosing, it is recommended for pediatric doses less than 50 mg that 50-mg vials (with a concentration of 5 mg/mL) be used if available. The 70-mg vial should be reserved for pediatric patients requiring doses greater than 50 mg. The maximum loading dose and the daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg, regardless of the patient's calculated dose. 2.7 Drug Incompatibilities Do not mix or co-infuse CANCIDAS with other medications, as there are no data available on the compatibility of CANCIDAS with other intravenous substances, additives, or medications. Do not use diluents containing dextrose (α-D-glucose), as CANCIDAS is not stable in diluents containing dextrose.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE CANCIDAS is an echinocandin antifungal indicated in adults and pediatric patients (3 months of age and older) for: Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections in febrile, neutropenic patients.

CARBAMAZEPINE,N/A,N/A,Somnolence,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests ). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patients. A low initial daily dosage with gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be taken with or without food. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be swallowed whole or may be opened and all the beads sprinkled on a teaspoon of soft food such as applesauce. Make sure all of the food and medicine mixture is swallowed. Do not crush or chew carbamazepine extended-release capsules or the sprinkled beads. Carbamazepine extended-release capsule is an extended-release formulation for twice a day administration. When converting patients from immediate release carbamazepine to carbamazepine extended-release capsules, the same total daily mg dose of carbamazepine should be administered. Following conversion to carbamazepine, patients should be closely monitored for seizure control. Depending on the therapeutic response after conversion, the total daily dose may need to be adjusted within the recommended dosing instructions. Epilepsy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Adults and children over 12 years of age. Initial: 200 mg twice daily. Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1,000 mg per day in children 12 to 15 years of age, and 1,200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1,600 mg daily have been used in adults. Maintenance: Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 800 to 1,200 mg daily. Children under 12 years of age: Children taking total daily dosages of immediate-release carbamazepine of 400 mg or greater may be converted to the same total daily dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules, using a twice daily regimen. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of carbamazepine extended-release capsules for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made. Combination Therapy: Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Trigeminal Neuralgia (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Initial: On the first day, start with one 200 mg capsule. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day every 12 hours only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. Do not exceed 1,200 mg daily. Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400 to 800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Epilepsy Carbamazepine extended-release capsules are indicated for use as an anticonvulsant drug. Evidence supporting efficacy of carbamazepine as an anticonvulsant was derived from active drug-controlled studies that enrolled patients with the following seizure types: Partial seizures with complex symptomatology (psychomotor, temporal lobe). Patients with these seizures appear to show greater improvements than those with other types. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). Mixed seizure patterns which include the above, or other partial or generalized seizures. Absence seizures (petit mal) do not appear to be controlled by carbamazepine (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Trigeminal Neuralgia Carbamazepine extended-release capsules are indicated in the treatment of the pain associated with true trigeminal neuralgia. Beneficial results have also been reported in glossopharyngeal neuralgia. This drug is not a simple analgesic and should not be used for the relief of trivial aches or pains.","OVERDOSAGE Acute Toxicity Lowest known lethal dose: adults, >60 g (39-year-old man). Highest known doses survived: adults, 30 g (31-year-old woman); children, 10 g (6-year-old boy); small children, 5 g (3-year-old girl). Oral LD 50 in animals (mg/kg): mice, 1100 to 3750; rats, 3850 to 4025; rabbits, 1500 to 2680; guinea pigs, 920. Signs and Symptoms The first signs and symptoms appear after 1 to 3 hours. Neuromuscular disturbances are the most prominent. Cardiovascular disorders are generally milder, and severe cardiac complications occur only when very high doses (>60 g) have been ingested. Respiration: Irregular breathing, respiratory depression. Cardiovascular System: Tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension, shock, conduction disorders. Nervous System and Muscles: Impairment of consciousness ranging in severity to deep coma. Convulsions, especially in small children. Motor restlessness, muscular twitching, tremor, athetoid movements, opisthotonos, ataxia, drowsiness, dizziness, mydriasis, nystagmus, adiadochokinesia, ballism, psychomotor disturbances, dysmetria. Initial hyperreflexia, followed by hyporeflexia. Gastrointestinal Tract: Nausea, vomiting. Kidneys and Bladder: Anuria or oliguria, urinary retention. Laboratory Findings: Isolated instances of overdosage have included leukocytosis, reduced leukocyte count, glycosuria, and acetonuria. ECG may show dysrhythmias. Combined Poisoning: When alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, or hydantoins are taken at the same time, the signs and symptoms of acute poisoning with carbamazepine may be aggravated or modified. Treatment For the most up to date information on management of carbamazepine overdose, please contact the poison center for your area by calling 1-800-222-1222. The prognosis in cases of carbamazepine poisoning is generally favorable. Of 5,645 cases of carbamazepine exposures reported to US poison centers in 2002, a total of 8 deaths (0.14% mortality rate) occurred. Over 39% of the cases reported to these poison centers were managed safely at home with conservative care. Successful management of large or intentional carbamazepine exposures requires implementation of supportive care, frequent monitoring of serum drug concentrations, as well as aggressive but appropriate gastric decontamination. Elimination of the Drug: The primary method for gastric decontamination of carbamazepine overdose is use of activated charcoal. For substantial recent ingestions, gastric lavage may also be considered. Administration of activated charcoal prior to hospital assessment has the potential to significantly reduce drug absorption. There is no specific antidote. In overdose, absorption of carbamazepine may be prolonged and delayed. More than one dose of activated charcoal may be beneficial in patients that have evidence of continued absorption (e.g., rising serum carbamazepine levels). Measures to Accelerate Elimination: The data on use of dialysis to enhance elimination in carbamazepine is scarce. Dialysis, particularly high flux or high efficiency hemodialysis, may be considered in patients with severe carbamazepine poisoning associated with renal failure or in cases of status epilepticus, or where there are rising serum drug levels and worsening clinical status despite appropriate supportive care and gastric decontamination. For severe cases of carbamazepine overdose unresponsive to other measures, charcoal hemoperfusion may be used to enhance drug clearance. Respiratory Depression: Keep the airways free; resort, if necessary, to endotracheal intubation, artificial respiration, and administration of oxygen. Hypotension, Shock: Keep the patient's legs raised and administer a plasma expander. If blood pressure fails to rise despite measures taken to increase plasma volume, use of vasoactive substances should be considered. Convulsions: Diazepam or barbiturates. Warning: Diazepam or barbiturates may aggravate respiratory depression (especially in children), hypotension, and coma. However, barbiturates should not be used if drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase have also been taken by the patient either in overdosage or in recent therapy (within 1 week). Surveillance: Respiration, cardiac function (ECG monitoring), blood pressure, body temperature, pupillary reflexes, and kidney and bladder function should be monitored for several days. Treatment of Blood Count Abnormalities: If evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops, the following recommendations are suggested: (1) stop the drug, (2) perform daily CBC, platelet, and reticulocyte counts, (3) do a bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy immediately and repeat with sufficient frequency to monitor recovery. Special periodic studies might be helpful as follows: (1) white cell and platelet antibodies, (2) 59 Fe-ferrokinetic studies, (3) peripheral blood cell typing, (4) cytogenetic studies on marrow and peripheral blood, (5) bone marrow culture studies for colony-forming units, (6) hemoglobin electrophoresis for A2 and F hemoglobin, and (7) serum folic acid and B 12 levels. A fully developed aplastic anemia will require appropriate, intensive monitoring and therapy, for which specialized consultation should be sought.",Bryant Ranch Prepack,CARBAMAZEPINE

Neuropathic Pain Associated with Spinal Cord Injury ( 2.6 ) 2 divided doses per day 300 mg/day within 1 week. Maximum dose of 600 mg/day. Dose should be adjusted in adult patients with reduced renal function. ( 2.7 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Pregabalin capsules are given orally with or without food. When discontinuing pregabalin capsules, taper gradually over a minimum of 1 week [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Because pregabalin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in adult patients with reduced renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 2.2 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Adults The maximum recommended dose of pregabalin capsules is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Although pregabalin was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 300 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.3 Postherpetic Neuralgia in Adults The recommended dose of pregabalin capsules is 75 to 150 mg two times a day, or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day, or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day, and who are able to tolerate pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day, or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day). In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, reserve dosing above 300 mg/day for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 300 mg daily [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.4 Adjunctive Therapy for Partial-Onset Seizures in Patients 1 Month of Age and Older The recommended dosages for adults and pediatric patients 1 month of age and older are included in Table 1. Administer the total daily dosage orally in two or three divided doses as indicated in Table 1. In pediatric patients, the recommended dosing regimen is dependent upon body weight. Based on clinical response and tolerability, dosage may be increased, approximately weekly. Table 1. Recommended Dosage for Adults and Pediatric Patients 1 Month and Older Age and Body Weight Recommended Initial Dosage Recommended Maximum Dosage Frequency of Administration Adults (17 years and older) 150 mg/day 600 mg/day 2 or 3 divided doses Pediatric patients weighing 30 kg or more 2.5 mg/kg/day 10 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 600 mg/day) 2 or 3 divided doses Pediatric patients weighing less than 30 kg 3.5 mg/kg/day 14 mg/kg/day 1 month to less than 4 years of age: 3 divided doses 4 years of age and older: 2 or 3 divided doses Both the efficacy and adverse event profiles of pregabalin have been shown to be dose-related. The effect of dose escalation rate on the tolerability of pregabalin has not been formally studied. The efficacy of adjunctive pregabalin in patients taking gabapentin has not been evaluated in controlled trials. Consequently, dosing recommendations for the use of pregabalin with gabapentin cannot be offered. 2.5 Management of Fibromyalgia in Adults The recommended dose of pregabalin capsules for fibromyalgia is 300 to 450 mg/day. Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day). Although pregabalin was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 450 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 2.6 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Spinal Cord Injury in Adults The recommended dose range of pregabalin capsules for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury is 150 to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . 2.7 Dosing for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment In view of dose-dependent adverse reactions and since pregabalin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in adult patients with reduced renal function. The use of pregabalin capsules in pediatric patients with compromised renal function has not been studied. Base the dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment on creatinine clearance (CLcr), as indicated in Table 2. To use this dosing table, an estimate of the patient's CLcr in mL/min is needed. CLcr in mL/min may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the Cockcroft and Gault equation: Next, refer to the Dosage and Administration section to determine the recommended total daily dose based on indication, for a patient with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min). Then refer to Table 2 to determine the corresponding renal adjusted dose. (For example: A patient initiating pregabalin therapy for postherpetic neuralgia with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min), receives a total daily dose of 150 mg/day pregabalin. Therefore, a renal impaired patient with a CLcr of 50 mL/min would receive a total daily dose of 75 mg/day pregabalin administered in two or three divided doses.) For patients undergoing hemodialysis, adjust the pregabalin daily dose based on renal function. In addition to the daily dose adjustment, administer a supplemental dose immediately following every 4-hour hemodialysis treatment (see Table 2). Table 2.

VENCLEXTA,77,801,Depression,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION See Full Prescribing Information for recommended VENCLEXTA dosages. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Take VENCLEXTA tablets orally once daily with a meal and water. Do not chew, crush, or break tablets. ( 2.8 ) Provide prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome. ( 2.1 , 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Safety Information Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA dosing begins with a 5-week ramp-up. The 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule is designed to gradually reduce tumor burden (debulk) and decrease the risk of TLS. VENCLEXTA 5-week Dose Ramp-Up Schedule Administer VENCLEXTA according to the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule to the recommended dosage of 400 mg orally once daily as shown in Table 1 . Table 1. Dosing Schedule for 5-Week Ramp-up Phase for Patients with CLL/SLL VENCLEXTA Oral Daily Dose Week 1 20 mg Week 2 50 mg Week 3 100 mg Week 4 200 mg Week 5 and beyond 400 mg The CLL/SLL Starting Pack provides the first 4 weeks of VENCLEXTA according to the ramp-up schedule [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . In Combination with Obinutuzumab Start obinutuzumab administration at 100 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by 900 mg on Cycle 1 Day 2. Administer 1000 mg on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle for a total of 6 cycles. Refer to the obinutuzumab prescribing information for additional dosing information. On Cycle 1 Day 22, start VENCLEXTA according to the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule (see Table 1 ). After completing the ramp-up phase on Cycle 2 Day 28, continue VENCLEXTA at a dose of 400 mg orally once daily from Cycle 3 Day 1 until the last day of Cycle 12. In Combination with Rituximab Start rituximab administration after the patient has completed the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule for VENCLEXTA (see Table 1 ) and has received VENCLEXTA at the recommended dosage of 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days. Administer rituximab on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles, at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 intravenously for Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m 2 intravenously for Cycles 2-6. Continue VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab. Refer to the rituximab prescribing information for additional dosing information. Monotherapy The recommended dosage of VENCLEXTA is 400 mg once daily after completion of the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule (see Table 1 ). Continue VENCLEXTA until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Acute Myeloid Leukemia The recommended dosage and ramp-up of VENCLEXTA depends upon the combination agent. Follow the dosing schedule, including the 3-day or 4-day dose ramp-up, as shown in Table 2. Start VENCLEXTA administration on Cycle 1 Day 1 in combination with: Azacitidine 75 mg/m 2 intravenously or subcutaneously once daily on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle; OR Decitabine 20 mg/m 2 intravenously once daily on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle; OR Cytarabine 20 mg/m 2 subcutaneously once daily on Days 1-10 of each 28-day cycle.

Refer to Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Prescribing Information for azacitidine, decitabine, or cytarabine for additional dosing information. 2.4 Risk Assessment and Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome Patients treated with VENCLEXTA may develop tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Refer to the appropriate section below for specific details on management. Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of TLS and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week ramp-up phase. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase. TLS can also occur upon resumption of VENCLEXTA following a dosage interruption. See Table 4 and Table 5 for dose modifications of VENCLEXTA after interruption. The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, particularly reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] <80 mL/min) and tumor burden; splenomegaly may also increase the risk of TLS. Perform tumor burden assessments, including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scan), assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) in all patients and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Table 3 below describes the recommended TLS prophylaxis and monitoring during VENCLEXTA treatment based on tumor burden determination from clinical trial data. Consider all patient comorbidities before final determination of prophylaxis and monitoring schedule. Reassess the risk of TLS when reinitiating VENCLEXTA after a dosage interruption lasting more than 1 week during the ramp-up phase, or more than 2 weeks after completion of ramp-up. Institute prophylaxis and monitoring as needed. Table 3.

Acute Myeloid Leukemia All patients should have white blood cell count less than 25 × 10 9 /L prior to initiation of VENCLEXTA. Cytoreduction prior to treatment may be required. Prior to first VENCLEXTA dose, provide all patients with prophylactic measures including adequate hydration and anti-hyperuricemic agents and continue during ramp-up phase. Assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. Monitor blood chemistries for TLS at pre-dose, 6 to 8 hours after each new dose during ramp-up, and 24 hours after reaching final dose. For patients with risk factors for TLS (e.g., circulating blasts, high burden of leukemia involvement in bone marrow, elevated pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels, or reduced renal function), consider additional measures, including increased laboratory monitoring and reducing VENCLEXTA starting dose. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma The recommended dosage modifications for VENCLEXTA for adverse reactions are provided in Table 4 and the recommended dose reductions for VENCLEXTA for adverse reactions are provided in Table 5. For patients having a dosage interruption lasting more than 1 week during the ramp-up phase, or more than 2 weeks after completion of ramp-up, reassess for risk of TLS to determine if reinitiation with a reduced dose is necessary (e.g., all or some levels of the dose ramp-up schedule) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )].

Take VENCLEXTA at approximately the same time each day. Swallow VENCLEXTA tablets whole. Do not chew, crush, or break tablets prior to swallowing. The recommended dosage of VENCLEXTA may be delivered using any of the approved tablet strengths (e.g., patients can take 2 x 50 mg tablets or 10 x 10 mg tablets instead of 1 x 100 mg tablet as needed). If the patient misses a dose of VENCLEXTA within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, instruct the patient to take the missed dose as soon as possible and resume the normal daily dosing schedule. If a patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, instruct the patient not to take the missed dose and resume the usual dosing schedule the next day. If the patient vomits following dosing, instruct the patient to not take an additional dose that day and to take the next prescribed dose at the usual time.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE VENCLEXTA is a BCL-2 inhibitor indicated: For the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

( 2.3 ) • See Full Prescribing Information for complete preparation and administration information. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Administration Information BENLYSTA may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]. Vials are intended for intravenous use only (not for subcutaneous use) and autoinjectors and prefilled syringes are intended for subcutaneous use only (not for intravenous use). 2.2 Recommended Intravenous Dosage for Adult and Pediatric Patients with SLE or Lupus Nephritis Dosage BENLYSTA for intravenous use must be reconstituted and diluted prior to administration. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. The recommended intravenous dosage is 10 mg/kg at 2‑week intervals for the first 3 doses and at 4‑week intervals thereafter. Reconstitute, dilute, and administer as an intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction. The infusion must be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences a serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Precautions Prior to Intravenous Use BENLYSTA should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Prior to intravenous dosing with BENLYSTA, consider administering premedication for prophylaxis against infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Preparation of Intravenous Solutions BENLYSTA for intravenous use is provided as a lyophilized powder in a single‑dose vial and should be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique as follows. Use of a 21- to 25-gauge needle is recommended when piercing the vial stopper for reconstitution and dilution. Reconstitution Instructions for Intravenous Use: 1. Remove the vial of BENLYSTA from the refrigerator and allow to stand for 10 to 15 minutes for the vial to reach room temperature. 2. Reconstitute the BENLYSTA powder with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, as follows. The reconstituted solution will contain a concentration of 80 mg/mL belimumab. 3. Reconstitute the 120-mg vial with 1.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 4. Reconstitute the 400-mg vial with 4.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 5. The stream of sterile water should be directed toward the side of the vial to minimize foaming. Gently swirl the vial for 60 seconds. Allow the vial to sit at room temperature during reconstitution, gently swirling the vial for 60 seconds every 5 minutes until the powder is dissolved. Do not shake. Reconstitution is typically complete within 10 to 15 minutes after the sterile water has been added, but it may take up to 30 minutes. Protect the reconstituted solution from sunlight. 6. If a mechanical reconstitution device (swirler) is used to reconstitute BENLYSTA, it should not exceed 500 rpm and the vial swirled for no longer than 30 minutes. 7. Once reconstitution is complete, the solution should be opalescent and colorless to pale yellow, and without particles. Small air bubbles, however, are expected and acceptable. Dilution Instructions for Intravenous Use: 1. Dextrose intravenous solutions are incompatible with BENLYSTA. BENLYSTA should only be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline), 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (half-normal saline), or Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to a volume of 250 mL for intravenous infusion. To prepare the intravenous infusion solution for patients whose body weight is less than or equal to 40 kg, a 100 mL bag or bottle of normal saline, half-normal saline, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection may be used such that the resulting belimumab concentration in the infusion bag does not exceed 4 mg/mL. From a 250‑mL (or 100‑mL) infusion bag or bottle of normal saline, half-normal saline, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection, withdraw and discard a volume equal to the volume of the reconstituted solution of BENLYSTA required for the patient’s dose. Then add the required volume of the reconstituted solution of BENLYSTA into the intravenous infusion solution in the infusion bag or bottle. Gently invert the bag or bottle to mix the intravenous infusion solution. Any unused solution in the vials must be discarded. 2. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discoloration is observed. 3. The reconstituted solution of BENLYSTA, if not used immediately, should be stored protected from direct sunlight and refrigerated at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C). Solutions of BENLYSTA diluted in normal saline, half-normal saline, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection may be stored at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C) or room temperature. The total time from reconstitution of BENLYSTA to completion of infusion should not exceed 8 hours. 4. No incompatibilities between BENLYSTA and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin bags have been observed. Administration Instructions for Intravenous Use 1. The diluted solution of BENLYSTA should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. 2. BENLYSTA should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the coadministration of BENLYSTA with other agents. 2.3 Recommended Subcutaneous Dosage The recommended dosages of BENLYSTA, when administered subcutaneously, are provided in Table 1 . When administered subcutaneously, BENLYSTA should be administered in the patient’s abdomen or thigh. For patients less than 10 years of age, BENLYSTA must be administered by a healthcare professional or trained caregiver. Table 1. Recommended Subcutaneous Dosage of BENLYSTA a Autoinjector only . NOTE: The prefilled syringe has not been studied in children less than 18 years of age. b The 400-mg dose is recommended for adult patients initiating therapy with BENLYSTA for active lupus nephritis and requires administration of 2 autoinjectors or 2 prefilled syringes.

Lupus Nephritis : A patient with lupus nephritis may transition from intravenous therapy with BENLYSTA to subcutaneous therapy after the patient completes the first 2 intravenous doses. If transitioning, administer the first subcutaneous dose of 200 mg 1 to 2 weeks after the last intravenous dose. Administration Instructions for Subcutaneous Injection 1. It is recommended that the first subcutaneous injection of BENLYSTA should be under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The healthcare provider should provide proper training in subcutaneous technique and education about signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . A patient may self-inject or the patient caregiver may administer BENLYSTA subcutaneously after the healthcare provider determines it is appropriate. 2. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to follow the directions for administration provided in the Instructions for Use. 3. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to remove the autoinjector or prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to the subcutaneous injection. Do not warm BENLYSTA in any other way. 4. Prior to administration, instruct the patient or patient caregiver to visually inspect the window of the autoinjector or the prefilled syringe for particulate matter or discoloration. BENLYSTA should be clear to opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Do not use BENLYSTA if the product exhibits discoloration or particulate matter. Instruct the patient not to use the BENLYSTA autoinjector or prefilled syringe if dropped on a hard surface. 5. When injecting in the same body region, advise the patient or patient caregiver to use a different injection site for each injection; never give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. When a 400-mg dose is administered at the same site, it is recommended that the 2 individual 200-mg injections be administered at least 5 cm (approximately 2 inches) apart. 6. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to administer BENLYSTA, preferably on the same day each week or the same day of alternate weeks, as appropriate. 7. If a dose is missed, instruct the patient to administer a dose as soon as the patient remembers. Thereafter, the patient can resume dosing on their usual day of administration or start a new schedule from the day that the missed dose was administered.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BENLYSTA (belimumab) is indicated for the treatment of: • patients 5 years of age and older with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are receiving standard therapy, and • patients 5 years of age and older with active lupus nephritis who are receiving standard therapy.

SYNTHROID,96,801,Death,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer once daily, preferably on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. ( 2.1 ) Administer at least 4 hours before or after drugs that are known to interfere with absorption. ( 2.1 ) Evaluate the need for dose adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect absorption. ( 2.1 ) Advise patients to stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels. ( 2.2 ) Starting dose depends on a variety of factors, including age, body weight, cardiovascular status, and concomitant medications. Peak therapeutic effect may not be attained for 4-6 weeks. ( 2.2 ) See full prescribing information for dosing in specific patient populations. ( 2.3 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and/or T4 as well as clinical status. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Administer SYNTHROID as a single daily dose, on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours before or after drugs known to interfere with SYNTHROID absorption [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Evaluate the need for dosage adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect SYNTHROID absorption [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 and 2.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.9 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Administer SYNTHROID to pediatric patients who cannot swallow intact tablets by crushing the tablet, suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5 to 10 mL) of water and immediately administering the suspension by spoon or dropper. Ensure the patient ingests the full amount of the suspension. Do not store the suspension. Do not administer in foods that decrease absorption of SYNTHROID, such as soybean-based infant formula [see Drug Interactions ( 7.9 ) ] . 2.2 Important Considerations for Dosing The dosage of SYNTHROID for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dosage adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . For adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is not a reliable measure of SYNTHROID dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate SYNTHROID dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.10 )]. The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of SYNTHROID may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Titration Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Table 1. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Adults* Patient Population Starting Dosage Dosage Titration Based on Serum TSH or Free-T4 Adults diagnosed with hypothyroidism Full replacement dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day. Some patients require a lower starting dose. Titrate dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Adults at risk for atrial fibrillation or with underlying cardiac disease Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) Titrate dosage every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Geriatric patients Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) * Dosages greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily dosages greater than 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Table 2. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Ag e Starting Daily Dos ag e Per Kg Body Weight * 0-3 months 10-15 mcg/kg/day 3-6 months 8-10 mcg/kg/day 6-12 months 6-8 mcg/kg/day 1-5 years 5-6 mcg/kg/day 6-12 years 4-5 mcg/kg/day Greater than 12 years but growth and puberty incomplete 2-3 mcg/kg/day Growth and puberty complete 1.6 mcg/kg/day * Adjust dosage based on clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ] . Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached. Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. The recommended daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pregnant patients is described in Table 3. Table 3. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients Patient Population Starting Dosage Dose Adjustment and Titration Pre-existing primary hypothyroidism with serum TSH above normal trimester-specific range Pre-pregnancy dosage may increase during pregnancy Increase SYNTHROID dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Monitor TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. Reduce SYNTHROID dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery. Monitor serum TSH 4 to 8 weeks postpartum. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH ≥ 10 mIU per liter) 1.6 mcg/kg/day Monitor serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust SYNTHROID dosage until serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH < 10 mIU per liter) 1.0 mcg/kg/day TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Adult and Pediatric Patients The SYNTHROID dosage is based on the target level of TSH suppression for the stage and clinical status of thyroid cancer. 2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T4, and T3, resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Drug Interactions ( 7.10 )]. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of SYNTHROID may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dosage. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dosage, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient’s clinical status. Pediatric Patients In patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in pediatric patients as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dosage stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. The general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level. TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of SYNTHROID therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the patient is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of SYNTHROID [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypothyroidism SYNTHROID is indicated in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates, as a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

For twice daily dosing, administer the evening dose with the evening meal, at bedtime, or 12 hours after the morning dose. • Individualize and titrate the dose of LEVEMIR based on the patient’s metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal. • Dose adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. • In patients with type 1 diabetes, LEVEMIR must be used in a regimen with rapid-acting or short-acting insulin. 2.3 Starting Dose in Insulin Naïve Patients Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The recommended starting dose of LEVEMIR in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be administered as short-acting pre-meal insulin. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin naïve patients with type 1 diabetes. Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dose of LEVEMIR in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic medications or a GLP-1 receptor agonist is 10 units (or 0.1 units/kg to 0.2 units/kg) given once daily in the evening or divided into a twice daily regimen. 2.4 Switching to LEVEMIR from Other Insulin Therapies Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to LEVEMIR from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. • If converting from insulin glargine to LEVEMIR, the change can be done on a unit-to-unit basis. • If converting from NPH insulin, the change can be done on a unit-to-unit basis. However, some patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may require more LEVEMIR than NPH insulin, as observed in one trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] .",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE LEVEMIR is indicated to improve glycemic control in adult and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. Limitations of Use LEVEMIR is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. LEVEMIR is a long-acting human insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic control in adult and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus ( 1 ). Limitations of Use: Not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.,"10 OVERDOSAGE An excess of insulin relative to food intake, energy expenditure, or both may lead to severe and sometimes prolonged and life-threatening hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.6 )] . Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Lowering the insulin dosage, and adjustments in meal patterns, or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with a glucagon product for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose. After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia, continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately.",A-S Medication Solutions,INSULIN DETEMIR

SYNTHROID,68,801,Diverticulitis,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer once daily, preferably on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. ( 2.1 ) Administer at least 4 hours before or after drugs that are known to interfere with absorption. ( 2.1 ) Evaluate the need for dose adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect absorption. ( 2.1 ) Advise patients to stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels. ( 2.2 ) Starting dose depends on a variety of factors, including age, body weight, cardiovascular status, and concomitant medications. Peak therapeutic effect may not be attained for 4-6 weeks. ( 2.2 ) See full prescribing information for dosing in specific patient populations. ( 2.3 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and/or T4 as well as clinical status. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Administer SYNTHROID as a single daily dose, on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours before or after drugs known to interfere with SYNTHROID absorption [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Evaluate the need for dosage adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect SYNTHROID absorption [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 and 2.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.9 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Administer SYNTHROID to pediatric patients who cannot swallow intact tablets by crushing the tablet, suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5 to 10 mL) of water and immediately administering the suspension by spoon or dropper. Ensure the patient ingests the full amount of the suspension. Do not store the suspension. Do not administer in foods that decrease absorption of SYNTHROID, such as soybean-based infant formula [see Drug Interactions ( 7.9 ) ] . 2.2 Important Considerations for Dosing The dosage of SYNTHROID for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dosage adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . For adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is not a reliable measure of SYNTHROID dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate SYNTHROID dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.10 )]. The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of SYNTHROID may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Titration Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Table 1. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Adults* Patient Population Starting Dosage Dosage Titration Based on Serum TSH or Free-T4 Adults diagnosed with hypothyroidism Full replacement dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day. Some patients require a lower starting dose. Titrate dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Adults at risk for atrial fibrillation or with underlying cardiac disease Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) Titrate dosage every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Geriatric patients Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) * Dosages greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily dosages greater than 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Table 2. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Ag e Starting Daily Dos ag e Per Kg Body Weight * 0-3 months 10-15 mcg/kg/day 3-6 months 8-10 mcg/kg/day 6-12 months 6-8 mcg/kg/day 1-5 years 5-6 mcg/kg/day 6-12 years 4-5 mcg/kg/day Greater than 12 years but growth and puberty incomplete 2-3 mcg/kg/day Growth and puberty complete 1.6 mcg/kg/day * Adjust dosage based on clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ] . Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached. Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. The recommended daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pregnant patients is described in Table 3. Table 3. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients Patient Population Starting Dosage Dose Adjustment and Titration Pre-existing primary hypothyroidism with serum TSH above normal trimester-specific range Pre-pregnancy dosage may increase during pregnancy Increase SYNTHROID dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Monitor TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. Reduce SYNTHROID dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery. Monitor serum TSH 4 to 8 weeks postpartum. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH ≥ 10 mIU per liter) 1.6 mcg/kg/day Monitor serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust SYNTHROID dosage until serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH < 10 mIU per liter) 1.0 mcg/kg/day TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Adult and Pediatric Patients The SYNTHROID dosage is based on the target level of TSH suppression for the stage and clinical status of thyroid cancer. 2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T4, and T3, resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Drug Interactions ( 7.10 )]. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of SYNTHROID may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dosage. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dosage, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient’s clinical status. Pediatric Patients In patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in pediatric patients as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dosage stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. The general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level. TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of SYNTHROID therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the patient is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of SYNTHROID [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypothyroidism SYNTHROID is indicated in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates, as a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

[See Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Dosage Food/Timing See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) Reduction of Risk of Major Cardiovascular Events (CV Death, MI, and Stroke) in CAD No dose adjustment needed based on CrCl 2.5 mg twice daily , plus aspirin (75 to 100 mg) once daily Take with or without food Reduction of Risk of Major Thrombotic Vascular Events in PAD, Including Patients after Lower Extremity Revascularization due to Symptomatic PAD No dose adjustment needed based on CrCl 2.5 mg twice daily , plus aspirin (75 to 100 mg) once daily. When starting therapy after a successful lower extremity revascularization procedure, initiate once hemostasis has been established. Take with or without food 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 2.3 Switching to and from Rivaroxaban Tablets Switching from Warfarin to Rivaroxaban Tablets When switching patients from warfarin to rivaroxaban tablets, discontinue warfarin and start rivaroxaban tablets as soon as the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is below 3 in adults and below 2.5 in pediatric patients to avoid periods of inadequate anticoagulation. Switching from Rivaroxaban Tablets to Warfarin Adults: No clinical trial data are available to guide converting patients from rivaroxaban tablets to warfarin. Rivaroxaban tablet affects INR, so INR measurements made during coadministration with warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue rivaroxaban tablets and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of rivaroxaban tablets would have been taken. Once rivaroxaban is discontinued, INR testing may be done reliably 24 hours after the last dose. Switching from Rivaroxaban Tablets to Anticoagulants other than Warfarin Patients currently taking rivaroxaban tablets and transitioning to an anticoagulant with rapid onset, discontinue rivaroxaban tablet and give the first dose of the other anticoagulant (oral or parenteral) at the time that the next rivaroxaban tablets dose would have been taken [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Switching from Anticoagulants other than Warfarin to Rivaroxaban tablets Patients currently receiving an anticoagulant other than warfarin, start rivaroxaban tablets 0 to 2 hours prior to the next scheduled administration of the drug (e.g., low molecular weight heparin or non-warfarin oral anticoagulant) and omit administration of the other anticoagulant. For unfractionated heparin being administered by continuous infusion, stop the infusion and start rivaroxaban tablets at the same time. 2.4 Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions If anticoagulation must be discontinued to reduce the risk of bleeding with surgical or other procedures, rivaroxaban tablets should be stopped at least 24 hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . In deciding whether a procedure should be delayed until 24 hours after the last dose of rivaroxaban tablets, the increased risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention. Rivaroxaban tablets should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established, noting that the time to onset of therapeutic effect is short [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . If oral medication cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention, consider administering a parenteral anticoagulant. 2.5 Missed Dose Adults For patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily: if a dose is missed, the patient should take a single 2.5 mg rivaroxaban tablet dose as recommended at the next scheduled time. On the following day, the patient should continue with their regular regimen. 2.6 Administration Options For adult patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, rivaroxaban tablets (all strengths) may be crushed and mixed with applesauce immediately prior to use and administered orally. Administration with food is not required for the 2.5 mg tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Administration of Rivaroxaban Tablets via Nasogastric (NG) Tube or Gastric Feeding Tube: After confirming gastric placement of the tube, rivaroxaban tablets (all strengths) may be crushed and suspended in 50 mL of water and administered via an NG tube or gastric feeding tube. Since rivaroxaban absorption is dependent on the site of drug release, avoid administration of rivaroxaban tablets distal to the stomach which can result in reduced absorption and thereby, reduced drug exposure. Enteral feeding is not required following administration of the 2.5 mg tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Crushed rivaroxaban tablets (all strengths) are stable in water and in applesauce for up to 4 hours. An in vitro compatibility study indicated that there is no adsorption of rivaroxaban from a water suspension of a crushed rivaroxaban tablets to PVC or silicone nasogastric (NG) tubing.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor indicated: to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) ( 1.7 ) to reduce the risk of major thrombotic vascular events in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), including patients after recent lower extremity revascularization due to symptomatic PAD ( 1.8 ) 1.7 Reduction of Risk of Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Rivaroxaban tablets, in combination with aspirin, are indicated to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) in adult patients with coronary artery disease. 1.8 Reduction of Risk of Major Thrombotic Vascular Events in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), Including Patients after Lower Extremity Revascularization due to Symptomatic PAD Rivaroxaban tablets, in combination with aspirin, are indicated to reduce the risk of major thrombotic vascular events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, and major amputation of a vascular etiology) in adult patients with PAD, including patients who have recently undergone a lower extremity revascularization procedure due to symptomatic PAD.","10 OVERDOSAGE Overdose of rivaroxaban tablets may lead to hemorrhage. Discontinue rivaroxaban tablets and initiate appropriate therapy if bleeding complications associated with overdosage occur. Rivaroxaban systemic exposure is not further increased at single doses >50 mg due to limited absorption. The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of rivaroxaban tablets overdose may be considered. Due to the high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not dialyzable [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Partial reversal of laboratory anticoagulation parameters may be achieved with use of plasma products. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of rivaroxaban is available.","Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",RIVAROXABAN
CARBOPLATIN,78,801,Overlap syndrome,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOTE: Aluminium reacts with carboplatin causing precipitate formation and loss of potency, therefore, needles or intravenous sets containing aluminium parts that may come in contact with the drug must not be used for the preparation or administration of carboplatin injection. Single Agent Therapy Carboplatin injection, as a single agent, has been shown to be effective in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma at a dosage of 360 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks (alternatively see Formula Dosing ). In general, however, single intermittent courses of carboplatin should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 2,000 and the platelet count is at least 100,000. Combination Therapy with Cyclophosphamide In the chemotherapy of advanced ovarian cancer, an effective combination for previously untreated patients consists of: Carboplatin - 300 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (alternatively see Formula Dosing ). Cyclophosphamide - 600 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. For directions regarding the use and administration of cyclophosphamide please refer to its package insert (See CLINICAL STUDIES .) Intermittent courses of carboplatin in combination with cyclophosphamide should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 2,000 and the platelet count is at least 100,000. Dose Adjustment Recommendations Pretreatment platelet count and performance status are important prognostic factors for severity of myelosuppression in previously treated patients. The suggested dose adjustments for single agent or combination therapy shown in the table below are modified from controlled trials in previously treated and untreated patients with ovarian carcinoma. Blood counts were done weekly, and the recommendations are based on the lowest post-treatment platelet or neutrophil value. Platelets Neutrophils Adjusted Dose Percentages apply to carboplatin injection as a single agent or to both carboplatin and cyclophosphamide in combination. In the controlled studies, dosages were also adjusted at a lower level (50% to 60%) for severe myelosuppression. Escalations above 125% were not recommended for these studies. ( From Prior Course ) > 100,000 > 2,000 125% 50 - 100,000 500 - 2,000 No Adjustment < 50,000 < 500 75% Carboplatin injection is usually administered by an infusion lasting 15 minutes or longer. No pre- or post-treatment hydration or forced diuresis is required. Patients with Impaired Kidney Function Patients with creatinine clearance values below 60 mL/min are at increased risk of severe bone marrow suppression. In renally-impaired patients who received single agent carboplatin therapy, the incidence of severe leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia has been about 25% when the dosage modifications in the table below have been used. Baseline Creatinine Clearance Recommended Dose on Day 1 41 - 59 mL/min 250 mg/m 2 16 - 40 mL/min 200 mg/m 2 The data available for patients with severely impaired kidney function (creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min) are too limited to permit a recommendation for treatment. These dosing recommendations apply to the initial course of treatment. Subsequent dosages should be adjusted according to the patient's tolerance based on the degree of bone marrow suppression. Formula Dosing Another approach for determining the initial dose of carboplatin injection is the use of mathematical formulae, which are based on a patient's pre-existing renal function or renal function and desired platelet nadir. Renal excretion is the major route of elimination for carboplatin (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY .) The use of dosing formulae, as compared to empirical dose calculation based on body surface area, allows compensation for patient variations in pretreatment renal function that might otherwise result in either underdosing (in patients with above average renal function) or overdosing (in patients with impaired renal function). A simple formula for calculating dosage, based upon a patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR in mL/min) and carboplatin injection target area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC in mg/mL•min), has been proposed by Calvert. In these studies, GFR was measured by 51 Cr-EDTA clearance. CALVERT FORMULA FOR CARBOPLATIN DOSING Total Dose (mg) = (target AUC) × (GFR + 25) Note: With the Calvert formula, the total dose of carboplatin is calculated in mg, not mg/m m 2 The target AUC of 4 mg/mL•min to 6 mg/mL•min using single agent carboplatin appears to provide the most appropriate dose range in previously treated patients. This study also showed a trend between the AUC of single agent carboplatin administered to previously treated patients and the likelihood of developing toxicity. % Actual Toxicity in Previously Treated Patients AUC ( mg / mL ∙ min ) Gr 3 or Gr 4 Thrombocytopenia Gr 3 or Gr 4 Leukopenia 4 to 5 16% 13% 6 to 7 33% 34% Geriatric Dosing Because renal function is often decreased in elderly patients, formula dosing of carboplatin injection based on estimates of GFR should be used in elderly patients to provide predictable plasma carboplatin injection AUCs and thereby minimize the risk of toxicity.","INDICATIONS Initial Treatment of Advanced Ovarian Carcinoma Carboplatin injection is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents. One established combination regimen consists of carboplatin and cyclophosphamide. Two randomized controlled studies conducted by the NCIC and SWOG with carboplatin versus cisplatin, both in combination with cyclophosphamide, have demonstrated equivalent overall survival between the two groups (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). There is limited statistical power to demonstrate equivalence in overall pathologic complete response rates and long-term survival (≥ 3 years) because of the small number of patients with these outcomes: the small number of patients with residual tumor < 2 cm after initial surgery also limits the statistical power to demonstrate equivalence in this subgroup. Secondary Treatment of Advanced Ovarian Carcinoma Carboplatin injection is indicated for the palliative treatment of patients with ovarian carcinoma recurrent after prior chemotherapy, including patients who have been previously treated with cisplatin. Within the group of patients previously treated with cisplatin, those who have developed progressive disease while receiving cisplatin therapy may have a decreased response rate.",OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for carboplatin injection overdosage. The anticipated complications of overdosage would be secondary to bone marrow suppression and/or hepatic toxicity.,Apotex Corp.,CARBOPLATIN

Patient Selection for Single-Agent Treatment Select patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent based on the presence of positive PD-L1 expression in: Stage III NSCLC who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . metastatic NSCLC [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. first-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . previously treated recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.12) ] . For the MSI-H/dMMR indications, select patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent based on MSI-H/dMMR status in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.8 , 14.9) ]. For the TMB-H indication, select patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent based on TMB-H status in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.18) ]. Because subclonal dMMR mutations and microsatellite instability may arise in high-grade gliomas during temozolomide therapy, it is recommended to test for TMB-H, MSI-H, and dMMR in the primary tumor specimens obtained prior to initiation of temozolomide chemotherapy in patients with high-grade gliomas. Additional Patient Selection Information for MSI-H or dMMR in Patients with non-CRC Solid Tumors Due to discordance between local tests and FDA-approved tests, confirmation of MSI-H or dMMR status is recommended by an FDA-approved test in patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors, if feasible. If unable to perform confirmatory MSI-H/dMMR testing, the presence of TMB ≥10 mut/Mb, as determined by an FDA-approved test, may be used to select patients for treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.8) ] . Patient Selection for Combination Therapy For use of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab, select patients based on the presence of positive PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1) in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma [see Clinical Studies (14.10) ].

ROLUFTA ELLIPTA,78,801,Overlap syndrome,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION BREO ELLIPTA should be administered once daily every day by the orally inhaled route only. BREO ELLIPTA should be taken at the same time every day. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA more than 1 time every 24 hours. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 1 inhalation daily) of the prescribed strength of BREO ELLIPTA is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses. Patients using BREO ELLIPTA should not use additional LABA for any reason. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5, 5.8, 5.12).] • For oral inhalation only. ( 2 ) • Maintenance treatment of COPD: 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily. ( 2.1 ) • Asthma: 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 should be administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily, the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD. If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be taken for immediate relief. 2.2 Asthma If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be taken for immediate relief. The recommended starting dosage is BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily. The starting dosage is based on patients’ asthma severity. For patients previously treated with low- to mid-dose corticosteroid–containing treatment, BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 should be considered. For patients previously treated with mid- to high-dose corticosteroid–containing treatment, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 should be considered. The median time to onset, defined as a 100-mL increase from baseline in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), was approximately 15 minutes after beginning treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, increasing the dose to BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 may provide additional improvement in asthma control. If a previously effective dosage regimen of BREO ELLIPTA fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of BREO ELLIPTA with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BREO ELLIPTA is a combination of fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol, a long-acting beta 2 ‑adrenergic agonist (LABA), indicated for: • Long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction and reducing exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (1.1) • Once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. ( 1.2 ) Important limitation: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm. ( 1.1 , 1.2 , 5.2 ) 1.1 Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease BREO ® ELLIPTA ® 100/25 is a combination inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (ICS/LABA) indicated for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily is the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD. Important Limitation of Use BREO ELLIPTA is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. 1.2 Treatment of Asthma BREO ELLIPTA is a combination ICS/LABA indicated for the once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, physicians should only prescribe BREO ELLIPTA for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue BREO ELLIPTA) if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Important Limitation of Use BREO ELLIPTA is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.","10 OVERDOSAGE No human overdosage data has been reported for BREO ELLIPTA. BREO ELLIPTA contains both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to BREO ELLIPTA. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of BREO ELLIPTA together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta‑receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medicine can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage. 10.1 Fluticasone Furoate Because of low systemic bioavailability (15.2%) and an absence of acute drug-related systemic findings in clinical trials, overdosage of fluticasone furoate is unlikely to require any treatment other than observation. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic effects such as hypercorticism may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Single- and repeat-dose trials of fluticasone furoate at doses of 50 to 4,000 mcg have been studied in human subjects. Decreases in mean serum cortisol were observed at dosages of 500 mcg or higher given once daily for 14 days. 10.2 Vilanterol The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of vilanterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis).

ALLOPURINOL,78,801,Overlap syndrome,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Gout : Prior to initiating treatment assess serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver and kidney function tests. Prophylactic treatment for gout flares is recommended. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Patients with normal kidney function: Initial dosage is 100 mg orally daily. Increase by 100 mg weekly increments until serum uric acid of 6 mg/dl or less is reached (maximum 800 mg daily). ( 2.3 ) Patients with impaired kidney function: The initial dosage is 50 mg orally daily. Follow recommendations for titration in patients with renal impairment until target serum uric acid level is reached. ( 2.6 ) See complete information in the Full Prescribing Information (FPI). Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy : The recommended dosage is: Adults: 300 mg to 800 mg orally daily. Pediatric patients: 100 mg/m 2 orally every 8 hours to 12 hours (10 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) See complete information in the FPI. ( 2.4 , 2.6 ) Recurrent Calcium Oxalate Calculi : The recommended initial dosage in patients with normal kidney function is 200 mg to 300 mg orally daily. ( 2.5 ) Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment: See FPI for dosage modifications in patients with renal impairment. ( 2.6 ) 2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR). 2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Gout The initial recommended dosage for the management of gout is 100 mg orally daily, with weekly increments of 100 mg, until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. Initiating treatment with lower dosages of allopurinol tablets and titrating slowly, decreases the risk of gout flares and drug induced serious adverse reactions. In patients with renal impairment the initial dosage is 50 mg orally daily with lower dose increases until serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. For complete dosage recommendations for patients with renal impairment see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. The minimal effective dosage is 100 mg to 200 mg daily and the maximal recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as a single equivalent dose with the 300 mg tablet. Doses in excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses. Monitor patients’ kidney function during the early stages of administration of allopurinol tablets and decrease the dosage or withdraw the drug if persistent abnormalities in kidney function occur [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. The dosage of allopurinol tablets to achieve control of gout varies with the severity of the disease. In general, gout control is achieved with 200 mg to 300 mg daily in patients with mild gout, and with 400 mg to 600 mg daily in patients with moderate to severe tophaceous gout. Gout attacks usually become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy. If a dose of allopurinol tablets is missed, there is no need to double the dose at the next scheduled time. Allopurinol tablets is generally better tolerated if taken following meals. A fluid intake sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least 2 liters and the maintenance of a neutral or preferably, slightly alkaline urine are desirable. Inform patients of the possibility of gout flares [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Instruct them to remain on allopurinol tablets if this occurs and to increase fluid intake during therapy to prevent kidney stones. Concurrent Use of Uricosuric Agents Some patients, may benefit using uricosuric agents concurrently, to reduce serum uric acid to target levels. When transferring a patient from a uricosuric agent to allopurinol tablets, reduce the dose of the uricosuric agent over a period of several weeks and increase the dose of allopurinol tablets gradually to the required dose needed to maintain target serum uric acid level. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy Initiate therapy with allopurinol tablets 24 hours to 48 hours before the start of chemotherapy known to cause tumor cell lysis. Administer fluids sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least 2 liters in adults (at least 100 mL/m 2 /hour in pediatric patients) with a neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine. The recommended dosage of allopurinol tablets is: Adult patients – 300 mg to 800 mg orally daily Pediatric patients - 100 mg/m 2 orally every 8 hours to 12 hours (10 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day). In patients with body surface area < 0.5 m 2 , consider using an alternative allopurinol formulation. The dosage of allopurinol tablets to maintain normal or near-normal serum uric acid varies with the severity of the disease. Monitor serum uric acid levels at least daily and administer allopurinol tablets at a dose and frequency to maintain the serum uric acid within the normal range. Discontinue allopurinol tablets when the risk of tumor lysis has abated (2 days to 3 days from start of chemotherapy). For complete dosage recommendations for patients with renal impairment, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Management of Recurrent Calcium Oxalate Calculi in Hyperuricosuric Patients The recommended dosage for the management of recurrent calcium oxalate stones in hyperuricosuric patients is 200 mg to 300 mg orally daily in divided doses or as the single equivalent. This dose may be adjusted depending upon the resultant control of the hyperuricosuria based upon subsequent 24-hour urinary urate determinations. 2.6 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment The recommended initial dosages of allopurinol tablets in adult patients with renal impairment are shown in Tables 1 and 2 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Gout The recommended initial dosages in adult patients with gout with impaired kidney function are shown in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Initiate treatment with a lower dose of allopurinol tablets and increase the dose gradually in 50 mg/day increments every 2 weeks to 4 weeks in patients with renal impairment to decrease the risk of drug induced serious adverse reactions. Use the lowest dose possible to achieve the desired effect on serum and/or urine uric acid. Monitor kidney function in gout patients with chronic kidney disease closely when initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets and decrease or withdraw the drug if increased abnormalities in kidney function appear and persist. Table 1. Recommended Initial Dosage in Adult Patients with Gout eGFR Initial Dosage > 60 mL/minute No dosage modification > 30 to 60 mL/minute 50 mg daily > 15 to 30 mL/minute 50 mg every other day 5 to 15 mL/minute 50 mg twice weekly < 5 mL/minute 50 mg once weekly The maximum dosage that should be used in patients with various levels of renal impairment is not defined at different eGFR levels. Patients with Recurrent Calcium Oxalate Calculi Data are insufficient to provide dosage recommendations for the treatment of recurrent calcium oxalate calculi in patients with renal impairment. Allopurinol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney, and accumulation of the drug can occur in renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy The recommended dosage of allopurinol tablets for the management of hyperuricemia associated with cancer therapy in adult patients with renal impairment is shown in Table 2 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )].

Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles. Administer LANTUS subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump. Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution. The LANTUS SoloStar prefilled pen dials in 1-unit increments. Use LANTUS SoloStar prefilled pen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. 2.2 General Dosing Instructions Administer LANTUS subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day. Individualize and adjust the dosage of LANTUS based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In patients with type 1 diabetes, LANTUS must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin. 2.3 Initiation of LANTUS Therapy Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of LANTUS in patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Use short-acting, premeal insulin to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements. Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of LANTUS in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. 2.4 Switching to LANTUS from Other Insulin Therapies Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to LANTUS from other insulin therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. When switching from: Once-daily TOUJEO (insulin glargine 300 units/mL) to once-daily LANTUS (100 units/mL), the recommended starting LANTUS dosage is 80% of the TOUJEO dosage that is being discontinued. Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS, the recommended starting LANTUS dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued. Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS, the recommended starting LANTUS dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE LANTUS is indicated to improve glycemic control in adult and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus.

( 1 )","10 OVERDOSAGE Human Experience There is limited clinical study experience regarding human overdosage with AUVELITY. Overdosage information is based on experience with the individual components, dextromethorphan and bupropion. Metabolism of the dextromethorphan component of AUVELITY is inhibited by the bupropion component, such that overdose due to AUVELITY might be more severe or more persistent compared to overdose of dextromethorphan alone. Dextromethorphan Symptoms of dextromethorphan overdose include nausea, vomiting, stupor, coma, respiratory depression, seizures, tachycardia, hyperexcitability, and toxic psychosis. Other adverse effects include ataxia, nystagmus, dystonia, blurred vision, and changes in muscle reflexes. Dextromethorphan may cause serotonin syndrome, and this risk is increased by overdose, particularly if taken with other serotonergic agents, SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants. Bupropion Overdoses of up to 30 grams or more of bupropion (approximately 143 times the maximum recommended dose of AUVELITY) have been reported. Seizure was reported in approximately one-third of all cases. Other serious reactions reported with overdoses of bupropion alone included hallucinations, loss of consciousness, mental status changes, sinus tachycardia, ECG changes such as conduction disturbances (including QRS prolongation) or arrhythmias, clonus, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia. Fever, muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported mainly when bupropion was part of multiple drug overdoses. Although most patients recovered without sequelae, deaths associated with overdoses of bupropion alone have been reported in patients ingesting large doses of the drug. Multiple uncontrolled seizures, bradycardia, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest prior to death were reported in these patients. Overdosage Management Treatment of dextromethorphan overdosage should be directed at symptomatic and supportive measures. There are no known antidotes for bupropion. In case of an overdose, provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdose. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Induction of emesis is not recommended.

FUROSEMIDE,76,801,Arthralgia,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Edema Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response. Adults: The usual initial dose of furosemide tablets is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of furosemide tablets may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states. Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving furosemide tablets on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week. When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ). Geriatric Patients: In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ). Pediatric Patients: The usual initial dose of oral furosemide in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level. Hypertension Therapy should be individualized according to the patient's response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain the therapeutic response. Adults: The usual initial dose of furosemide tablets for hypertension is 80 mg, usually divided into 40 mg twice a day. Dosage should then be adjusted according to response. If response is not satisfactory, add other antihypertensive agents. Changes in blood pressure must be carefully monitored when furosemide tablets are used with other antihypertensive drugs, especially during initial therapy. To prevent excessive drop in blood pressure, the dosage of other agents should be reduced by at least 50 percent when furosemide tablets are added to the regimen. As the blood pressure falls under the potentiating effect of furosemide tablets, a further reduction in dosage or even discontinuation of other antihypertensive drugs may be necessary. Geriatric Patients: In general, dose selection and dose adjustment for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Edema Furosemide tablets are indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Furosemide tablets are particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired. Hypertension Oral furosemide may be used in adults for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Hypertensive patients who cannot be adequately controlled with thiazides will probably also not be adequately controlled with furosemide alone.","OVERDOSAGE The principal signs and symptoms of overdose with furosemide are dehydration, blood volume reduction, hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, hypokalemia and hypochloremic alkalosis, and are extensions of its diuretic action. The acute toxicity of furosemide has been determined in mice, rats and dogs. In all three, the oral LD 50 exceeded 1000 mg/kg body weight, while the intravenous LD 50 ranged from 300 to 680 mg/kg. The acute intragastric toxicity in neonatal rats is 7 to 10 times that of adult rats. The concentration of furosemide in biological fluids associated with toxicity or death is not known. Treatment of overdosage is supportive and consists of replacement of excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Serum electrolytes, carbon dioxide level and blood pressure should be determined frequently. Adequate drainage must be assured in patients with urinary bladder outlet obstruction (such as prostatic hypertrophy).

METOPROLOL,76,801,Arthralgia,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer once daily with food or after a meal. Titrate at weekly or longer intervals as needed and tolerated. ( 2 ) Hypertension: Recommended starting dosage is 100 mg daily, in single or divided doses. ( 2.1 ) Angina Pectoris: Recommended starting dosage is 100 mg daily, given as two divided doses. ( 2.2 ) Myocardial Infarction: The starting dosage depends upon tolerance of intravenous metoprolol, see full prescribing information. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Hypertension Individualize the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses. Adjust dosage at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period. Larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. Measure blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day. 2.2 Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 2.3 Myocardial Infarction See prescribing information of intravenous metoprolol for dosage instructions for intravenous therapy. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose, initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose of metoprolol and continue for 48 hours. In the case of intolerance, reduce dose to 25 mg and administer for 48 hours. Titrate, based on tolerability, to a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol tartrate tablets beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metoprolol tartrate tablets are a beta-adrenergic blocker indicated for the treatment of: Hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1.1 ) Angina Pectoris. ( 1.2 ) Myocardial Infarction, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality when used in conjunction with intravenous metoprolol therapy in patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction in hemodynamically stable patients. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Hypertension Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Metoprolol tartrate tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Angina Pectoris Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris, to reduce angina attacks and to improve exercise tolerance. 1.3 Myocardial Infarction Metoprolol tartrate tablets are indicated in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality when used alone or in conjunction with intravenous metoprolol.","10 OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms - Overdosage of metoprolol may lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. Clinical presentation can also include: atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness/coma, nausea and vomiting. Treatment – Consider treating the patient with intensive care. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability. Beta-blocker overdose may result in significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, employ the following measures. Hemodialysis is unlikely to make a useful contribution to metoprolol elimination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Bradycardia: Evaluate the need for atropine, adrenergic-stimulating drugs or pacemaker to treat bradycardia and conduction disorders. Hypotension: Treat underlying bradycardia. Consider intravenous vasopressor infusion, such as dopamine or norepinephrine. Heart failure and shock: May be treated when appropriate with suitable volume expansion, injection of glucagon (if necessary, followed by an intravenous infusion of glucagon), intravenous administration of adrenergic drugs such as dobutamine, with α 1 receptor agonistic drugs added in presence of vasodilation. Bronchospasm: Can usually be reversed by bronchodilators.","PD-Rx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",METOPROLOL TARTRATE

Note: Needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with cisplatin should not be used for preparation or administration. Aluminum reacts with cisplatin, causing precipitate formation and a loss of potency. Metastatic Testicular Tumors The usual cisplatin dose for the treatment of testicular cancer in combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents is 20 mg/m 2 IV daily for 5 days per cycle. Metastatic Ovarian Tumors The usual cisplatin dose for the treatment of metastatic ovarian tumors in combination with cyclophosphamide is 75 to 100 mg/m 2 IV per cycle once every 4 weeks (DAY 1). The dose of cyclophosphamide when used in combination with cisplatin is 600 mg/m 2 IV once every 4 weeks (DAY 1). For directions for the administration of cyclophosphamide, refer to the cyclophosphamide package insert. In combination therapy, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide are administered sequentially. As a single agent, cisplatin should be administered at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 IV per cycle once every 4 weeks. Advanced Bladder Cancer Cisplatin should be administered as a single agent at a dose of 50 to 70 mg/m 2 IV per cycle once every 3 to 4 weeks depending on the extent of prior exposure to radiation therapy and/or prior chemotherapy. For heavily pretreated patients an initial dose of 50 mg/m 2 per cycle repeated every 4 weeks is recommended. All Patients Pretreatment hydration with 1 to 2 liters of fluid infused for 8 to 12 hours prior to a cisplatin dose is recommended. The drug is then diluted in 2 liters of 5% Dextrose in 1/2 or 1/3 normal saline containing 37.5 g of mannitol, and infused over a 6 hour to 8 hour period. If diluted solution is not to be used within 6 hours, protect solution from light. Do not dilute cisplatin in just 5% Dextrose Injection. Adequate hydration and urinary output must be maintained during the following 24 hours. A repeat course of cisplatin should not be given until the serum creatinine is below 1.5 mg/100 mL, and/or the BUN is below 25 mg/100 mL. A repeat course should not be given until circulating blood elements are at an acceptable level (platelets ≥ 100,000/mm 3 , WBC ≥ 4,000/mm 3 ). Subsequent doses of cisplatin should not be given until an audiometric analysis indicates that auditory acuity is within normal limits.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cisplatin Injection is indicated as therapy to be employed as follows: Metastatic Testicular Tumors In established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in patients with metastatic testicular tumors who have already received appropriate surgical and/or radio therapeutic procedures. Metastatic Ovarian Tumors In established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in patients with metastatic ovarian tumors who have already received appropriate surgical and/or radiotherapeutic procedures. An established combination consists of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. Cisplatin Injection, as a single agent, is indicated as secondary therapy in patients with metastatic ovarian tumors refractory to standard chemotherapy who have not previously received Cisplatin Injection therapy. Advanced Bladder Cancer Cisplatin Injection is indicated as a single agent for patients with transitional cell bladder cancer which is no longer amenable to local treatments, such as surgery and/or radiotherapy.","OVERDOSAGE Caution should be exercised to prevent inadvertent overdosage with cisplatin. Acute overdosage with this drug may result in kidney failure, liver failure, deafness, ocular toxicity (including detachment of the retina), significant myelosuppression, intractable nausea and vomiting and/or neuritis. In addition, death can occur following overdosage. No proven antidotes have been established for cisplatin overdosage. Hemodialysis, even when initiated four hours after the overdosage, appears to have little effect on removing platinum from the body because of cisplatin's rapid and high degree of protein binding. Management of overdosage should include general supportive measures to sustain the patient through any period of toxicity that may occur.",Sagent Pharmaceuticals,CISPLATIN

Tacrolimus extended-release capsules is not interchangeable or substitutable for tacrolimus extended-release tablets, tacrolimus immediate-release capsules or tacrolimus for oral suspension. Under or overexposure to tacrolimus may result in graft rejection or other serious adverse reactions. Changes between tacrolimus immediate-release and extended-release dosage forms must occur under physician supervision [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Advise patients to swallow tacrolimus extended-release capsules whole with liquid; patients must not chew, divide, or crush the capsules. Tacrolimus extended-release capsules should be taken consistently every morning at the same time to ensure consistent and maximum possible drug exposure, on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before a meal, or at least 2 hours after a meal [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. If a dose is missed, the dose may be taken up to 14 hours after the scheduled time (i.e., for a missed 8:00 AM dose, a dose may be taken by 10:00 PM). Beyond the 14-hour time frame, the patient should wait until the usual scheduled time the following morning to take the next regular daily dose. Instruct the patient not to double the next dose. Advise patients to avoid eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice or alcoholic beverages while taking tacrolimus extended-release capsules [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )].

However, due to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for African-American Patients, Patients with Hepatic Impairment, and Drug Interactions African-American patients, compared to Caucasian patients, may need to be titrated to higher tacrolimus extended-release capsules dosages to attain comparable trough concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh ≥ 10) may require a lower starting dosage of tacrolimus extended-release capsules, due to the reduced clearance and prolonged half-life [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Dose adjustments of tacrolimus extended-release capsules may be necessary when administered concomitantly with CYP3A inducers or CYP3A inhibitors or cannabidiol [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 , 5.15 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.3 )]. 2.4 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Measure tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations at least two times on separate days during the first week after initiation of dosing and after a change in dosage, after a change in co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers and/or inhibitors or cannabidiol [see Drug Interactions (7.2 , 7.3 )] , or after a change in renal or hepatic function. When interpreting measured concentrations, consider that the time to achieve tacrolimus steady state is approximately 7 days after initiating or changing the tacrolimus extended-release capsules dose. Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations using a validated assay [e.g., immunoassays or high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC/MS/MS)]. The immunosuppressive activity of tacrolimus is mainly due to the parent drug rather than to its metabolites. Immunoassays may react with metabolites as well as the parent drug. Therefore, whole blood tacrolimus trough concentrations obtained with immunoassays may be numerically higher than concentrations obtained with an assay using HPLC/MS/MS. Comparison of the whole blood tacrolimus trough concentrations of patients to those described in the prescribing information and other published literature must be made with knowledge of the assay method(s) employed.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tacrolimus extended-release capsules is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients in combination with other immunosuppressants in adult patients who can swallow capsules intact [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ), ( 14.2 )] .

Overdosage adverse reactions included: nervous system disorders (tremor, headache, confusional state, balance disorders, encephalopathy, lethargy and somnolence) gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) abnormal renal function (increased blood urea nitrogen and elevated serum creatinine) urticaria hypertension peripheral edema, and infections [one fatal postmarketing case of bilateral pneumopathy and CMV infection was attributed to tacrolimus (extended-release) overdose]. Based on the poor aqueous solubility and extensive erythrocyte and plasma protein binding, it is anticipated that tacrolimus is not dialyzable to any significant extent; there is no experience with charcoal hemoperfusion. The oral use of activated charcoal has been reported in treating acute overdoses, but experience has not been sufficient to warrant recommending its use. General supportive measures and treatment of specific symptoms should be followed in all cases of overdosage.","Chengdu Suncadia Medicine Co., Ltd.",TACROLIMUS EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES

PREDNISONE,47,801,Septic shock,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT ® (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing’s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1¼ to 1½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1.

Miscellaneous Tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement","WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. Infections with any pathogen including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic infections, in any location of the body, may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents that affect cellular immunity, humoral immunity, or neutrophil function. 1 These infections may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. 2 There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy: Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus.

These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered to patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. Indicated immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. The use of methylprednisolone tablets in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed, to chicken pox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.",Bryant Ranch Prepack,METHYLPREDNISOLONE

Administer into the upper-outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle. Gluteal injections should be alternated between the two gluteal muscles. 2.2 Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder For patients who have never taken oral paliperidone or oral or injectable risperidone, it is recommended to establish tolerability with oral paliperidone or oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA. The recommended dosing of INVEGA SUSTENNA for each approved indication is displayed in Table 1. The recommended initiation of INVEGA SUSTENNA is with a dose of 234 mg on treatment day 1 and 156 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle. Following the second initiation dose, monthly maintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Table 1: Recommended Dosing of INVEGA SUSTENNA for Adults with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Indication Initiation Dosing (deltoid) Monthly Maintenance Dose Administered 5 weeks after the first injection. (deltoid or gluteal) Maximum Monthly Dose Day 1 Day 8 Schizophrenia 234 mg 156 mg 39–234 mg The recommended maintenance dose for treatment of schizophrenia is 117 mg. Some patients may benefit from lower or higher maintenance doses within the additional available strengths (39 mg, 78 mg, 156 mg, and 234 mg). 234 mg Schizoaffective disorder 234 mg 156 mg 78–234 mg Adjust dose based on tolerability and/or efficacy using available strengths. The 39 mg strength was not studied in the long-term schizoaffective disorder study. 234 mg Adjustment of the maintenance dose may be made monthly. When making dose adjustments, the prolonged-release characteristics of INVEGA SUSTENNA should be considered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , as the full effect of the dose adjustment may not be evident for several months. 2.3 Missed Doses Avoiding Missed Doses It is recommended that the second initiation dose of INVEGA SUSTENNA be given one week after the first dose. To avoid a missed dose, patients may be given the second dose 4 days before or after the one-week time point. Similarly, the third and subsequent injections after the initiation regimen are recommended to be given monthly. To avoid a missed monthly dose, patients may be given the injection up to 7 days before or after the monthly time point. Management of a Missed Second Initiation Dose If the target date for the second INVEGA SUSTENNA injection (one week ± 4 days) is missed, the recommended reinitiation depends on the length of time which has elapsed since the patient's first injection. In case of a missed second initiation dose follow the dosing instructions provided in Table 2. Table 2: Management of a Missed Second Initiation Dose TIMING OF MISSED SECOND INITIATION DOSE DOSING Less than 4 weeks since first injection Administer the second initiation dose of 156 mg in the deltoid muscle as soon as possible. It is recommended to administer a third injection of 117 mg in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle 5 weeks after the first injection (regardless of the timing of the second injection). Thereafter, resume regular monthly dosing in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. 4 to 7 weeks since first injection Resume dosing with two injections of 156 mg in the following manner: Administer a deltoid injection as soon as possible. Administer a second deltoid injection 1 week later. Thereafter, resume regular monthly dosing in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. More than 7 weeks since first injection Restart dosing with recommended initiation (see Section 2.2, Table 1 ) : Administer a 234 mg deltoid injection on Day 1. Administer a 156 mg deltoid injection 1 week later. Thereafter, resume regular monthly dosing in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Management of a Missed Maintenance Dose In case of a missed maintenance dose follow the dosing instructions provided in Table 3. Table 3: Management of a Missed Maintenance Dose TIMING OF MISSED MAINTENANCE DOSE DOSING 4 to 6 weeks since last injection Resume regular monthly dosing as soon as possible at the patient's previously stabilized dose, followed by injections at monthly intervals. More than 6 weeks to 6 months since last injection Resume the same dose the patient was previously stabilized on (unless the patient was stabilized on a dose of 234 mg, then the first 2 injections should each be 156 mg) in the following manner: Administer a deltoid injection as soon as possible. Administer a second deltoid injection 1 week later at the same dose. Thereafter, resume administering the previously stabilized dose in the deltoid or gluteal muscle 1 month after the second injection. More than 6 months since last injection Restart dosing with recommended initiation ( see Section 2.2, Table 1 ) : Administer a 234 mg deltoid injection on Day 1. Administer a 156 mg deltoid injection 1 week later. Thereafter, resume administering the previously stabilized dose in the deltoid or gluteal muscle 1 month after the second injection. 2.4 Use with Risperidone or with Oral Paliperidone Since paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, caution should be exercised when INVEGA SUSTENNA is coadministered with risperidone or with oral paliperidone for extended periods of time. Safety data involving concomitant use of INVEGA SUSTENNA with other antipsychotics is limited. 2.5 Dosage Adjustments Patients with Renal Impairment INVEGA SUSTENNA has not been systematically studied in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min [Cockcroft-Gault Formula]), initiate INVEGA SUSTENNA with a dose of 156 mg on treatment Day 1 and 117 mg on Day 8, both in the deltoid muscle. Follow with the recommended monthly maintenance dose of 78 mg, administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Adjust monthly maintenance dose based on tolerability and/or efficacy within the strengths of 39 mg, 78 mg, 117 mg, or 156 mg. The maximum monthly dose is 156 mg for patients with mild renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . INVEGA SUSTENNA is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inducers Avoid using a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, St John's Wort) during the 1-month dosing interval for INVEGA SUSTENNA, if possible. If administering a strong inducer is necessary, consider managing the patient using paliperidone extended release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.6 Switching from Other Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from other antipsychotics to INVEGA SUSTENNA, or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. Switching from Oral Antipsychotics For patients who have never taken oral paliperidone or oral or injectable risperidone, tolerability should be established with oral paliperidone or oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA. Previous oral antipsychotics can be gradually discontinued at the time of initiation of treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA. Recommended initiation of INVEGA SUSTENNA is with a dose of 234 mg on treatment day 1 and 156 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Patients previously stabilized on different doses of INVEGA Extended-Release tablets can attain similar paliperidone steady-state exposure during maintenance treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA monthly doses as depicted in Table 4. Table 4: Doses of INVEGA and INVEGA SUSTENNA Needed to Attain Similar Steady-State Paliperidone Exposure During Maintenance Treatment Formulation INVEGA Extended-Release Tablet INVEGA SUSTENNA Injection Dosing Frequency Once Daily Once every 4 weeks Dose (mg) 12 234 9 156 6 117 3 39–78 Switching from Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics For patients who have never taken oral paliperidone or oral or injectable risperidone, tolerability should be established with oral paliperidone or oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA. When switching patients currently at steady-state on a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, initiate INVEGA SUSTENNA therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. INVEGA SUSTENNA should then be continued at monthly intervals. The one-week initiation dosing regimen as described in Section 2.2 is not required. See Table 1 above for recommended monthly maintenance dosing. Based on previous clinical history of tolerability and/or efficacy, some patients may benefit from lower or higher maintenance doses within the available strengths (39 mg, 78 mg, 117 mg, 156 mg, and 234 mg). The 39 mg strength was not studied in the long-term schizoaffective disorder study. Monthly maintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . If INVEGA SUSTENNA is discontinued, its prolonged-release characteristics must be considered. As recommended with other antipsychotic medications, the need for continuing existing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) medication should be re-evaluated periodically. 2.7 Instructions for Preparation and Administration Each injection must be administered only by a healthcare professional. The kit contains a prefilled syringe and 2 safety needles (a 1 ½-inch 22 gauge needle and a 1-inch 23 gauge needle) for intramuscular injection. INVEGA SUSTENNA is for single use only. Shake the syringe vigorously for a minimum of 10 seconds to ensure a homogeneous suspension. Select the appropriate needle. For DELTOID injection: If the patient weighs less than 90 kg, use the 1-inch 23 gauge needle (needle with blue colored hub). If the patient weighs 90 kg or more, use the 1 ½-inch 22 gauge needle (needle with gray colored hub). For GLUTEAL injection: Use the 1 ½-inch 22 gauge needle (needle with gray colored hub) regardless of patient's weight. Hold the syringe with the tip cap pointing up. Remove the rubber tip cap with a gentle twisting motion. Peel the safety needle pouch half way open. Grasp the needle sheath using the plastic peel pouch. Hold the syringe pointing up. Attach the safety needle to the syringe using a gentle twisting motion to avoid needle hub cracks or damage. Always check for signs of damage or leaking prior to administration. Pull the needle sheath away from the needle with a straight pull. Do not twist the sheath as the needle may be loosened from the syringe. Bring the syringe with the attached needle in upright position to de-aerate. De-aerate the syringe by moving the plunger rod carefully forward. Inject the entire contents intramuscularly slowly, deep into the selected deltoid or gluteal muscle of the patient. Do not administer by any other route. After the injection is complete, use either thumb or finger of one hand (h1, h2) or a flat surface (h3) to activate the needle protection system. The needle protection system is fully activated when a 'click' is heard. Discard the syringe with needle appropriately. h1 h2 h3 Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure h1 h2 h3",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE INVEGA SUSTENNA (paliperidone palmitate) is indicated for the treatment of: Schizophrenia in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ].

Because INVEGA SUSTENNA is to be administered by healthcare professionals, the potential for overdosage by patients is low. While experience with paliperidone overdose is limited, among the few cases of overdose reported in premarketing trials with oral paliperidone, the highest estimated ingestion was 405 mg. Observed signs and symptoms included extrapyramidal symptoms and gait unsteadiness. Other potential signs and symptoms include those resulting from an exaggeration of paliperidone's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and QT prolongation. Torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in a patient in the setting of overdose with oral paliperidone. Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. Overdose experience reported with risperidone can be found in the OVERDOSAGE section of the risperidone package insert. 10.2 Management of Overdosage Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for the most up to date information on the management of INVEGA SUSTENNA overdosage (1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org). Provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdosage. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures. There is no specific antidote to paliperidone. Consider the prolonged-release characteristics of INVEGA SUSTENNA and the long apparent half-life of paliperidone when assessing treatment needs and recovery.","Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE

The maximum monthly dose is 156 mg for patients with mild renal impairment. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Administration Instructions Each injection must be administered only by a healthcare professional. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for foreign matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever product and container permit. INVEGA SUSTENNA is intended for intramuscular use only. Do not administer by any other route. Avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel. Administer the dose in a single injection; do not administer the dose in divided injections. Inject slowly, deep into the deltoid or gluteal muscle. INVEGA SUSTENNA must be administered using only the needles that are provided in the INVEGA SUSTENNA kit. The recommended needle size for administration of INVEGA SUSTENNA into the deltoid muscle is determined by the patient's weight: For patients weighing less than 90 kg, the 1-inch, 23 gauge needle is recommended. For patients weighing 90 kg or more, the 1½-inch, 22 gauge needle is recommended. Deltoid injections should be alternated between the two deltoid muscles. The recommended needle size for administration of INVEGA SUSTENNA into the gluteal muscle is the 1½-inch, 22 gauge needle regardless of patient weight. Administer into the upper-outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle. Gluteal injections should be alternated between the two gluteal muscles. 2.2 Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder For patients who have never taken oral paliperidone or oral or injectable risperidone, it is recommended to establish tolerability with oral paliperidone or oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA. The recommended dosing of INVEGA SUSTENNA for each approved indication is displayed in Table 1. The recommended initiation of INVEGA SUSTENNA is with a dose of 234 mg on treatment day 1 and 156 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle. Following the second initiation dose, monthly maintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Table 1: Recommended Dosing of INVEGA SUSTENNA for Adults with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder Indication Initiation Dosing (deltoid) Monthly Maintenance Dose Administered 5 weeks after the first injection. (deltoid or gluteal) Maximum Monthly Dose Day 1 Day 8 Schizophrenia 234 mg 156 mg 39–234 mg The recommended maintenance dose for treatment of schizophrenia is 117 mg. Some patients may benefit from lower or higher maintenance doses within the additional available strengths (39 mg, 78 mg, 156 mg, and 234 mg). 234 mg Schizoaffective disorder 234 mg 156 mg 78–234 mg Adjust dose based on tolerability and/or efficacy using available strengths. The 39 mg strength was not studied in the long-term schizoaffective disorder study. 234 mg Adjustment of the maintenance dose may be made monthly. When making dose adjustments, the prolonged-release characteristics of INVEGA SUSTENNA should be considered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , as the full effect of the dose adjustment may not be evident for several months. 2.3 Missed Doses Avoiding Missed Doses It is recommended that the second initiation dose of INVEGA SUSTENNA be given one week after the first dose. To avoid a missed dose, patients may be given the second dose 4 days before or after the one-week time point. Similarly, the third and subsequent injections after the initiation regimen are recommended to be given monthly. To avoid a missed monthly dose, patients may be given the injection up to 7 days before or after the monthly time point. Management of a Missed Second Initiation Dose If the target date for the second INVEGA SUSTENNA injection (one week ± 4 days) is missed, the recommended reinitiation depends on the length of time which has elapsed since the patient's first injection. In case of a missed second initiation dose follow the dosing instructions provided in Table 2. Table 2: Management of a Missed Second Initiation Dose TIMING OF MISSED SECOND INITIATION DOSE DOSING Less than 4 weeks since first injection Administer the second initiation dose of 156 mg in the deltoid muscle as soon as possible. It is recommended to administer a third injection of 117 mg in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle 5 weeks after the first injection (regardless of the timing of the second injection). Thereafter, resume regular monthly dosing in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. 4 to 7 weeks since first injection Resume dosing with two injections of 156 mg in the following manner: Administer a deltoid injection as soon as possible. Administer a second deltoid injection 1 week later. Thereafter, resume regular monthly dosing in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. More than 7 weeks since first injection Restart dosing with recommended initiation (see Section 2.2, Table 1 ) : Administer a 234 mg deltoid injection on Day 1. Administer a 156 mg deltoid injection 1 week later. Thereafter, resume regular monthly dosing in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Management of a Missed Maintenance Dose In case of a missed maintenance dose follow the dosing instructions provided in Table 3. Table 3: Management of a Missed Maintenance Dose TIMING OF MISSED MAINTENANCE DOSE DOSING 4 to 6 weeks since last injection Resume regular monthly dosing as soon as possible at the patient's previously stabilized dose, followed by injections at monthly intervals. More than 6 weeks to 6 months since last injection Resume the same dose the patient was previously stabilized on (unless the patient was stabilized on a dose of 234 mg, then the first 2 injections should each be 156 mg) in the following manner: Administer a deltoid injection as soon as possible. Administer a second deltoid injection 1 week later at the same dose. Thereafter, resume administering the previously stabilized dose in the deltoid or gluteal muscle 1 month after the second injection. More than 6 months since last injection Restart dosing with recommended initiation ( see Section 2.2, Table 1 ) : Administer a 234 mg deltoid injection on Day 1. Administer a 156 mg deltoid injection 1 week later. Thereafter, resume administering the previously stabilized dose in the deltoid or gluteal muscle 1 month after the second injection. 2.4 Use with Risperidone or with Oral Paliperidone Since paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, caution should be exercised when INVEGA SUSTENNA is coadministered with risperidone or with oral paliperidone for extended periods of time. Safety data involving concomitant use of INVEGA SUSTENNA with other antipsychotics is limited. 2.5 Dosage Adjustments Patients with Renal Impairment INVEGA SUSTENNA has not been systematically studied in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min [Cockcroft-Gault Formula]), initiate INVEGA SUSTENNA with a dose of 156 mg on treatment Day 1 and 117 mg on Day 8, both in the deltoid muscle. Follow with the recommended monthly maintenance dose of 78 mg, administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle. Adjust monthly maintenance dose based on tolerability and/or efficacy within the strengths of 39 mg, 78 mg, 117 mg, or 156 mg. The maximum monthly dose is 156 mg for patients with mild renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . INVEGA SUSTENNA is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Inducers Avoid using a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, St John's Wort) during the 1-month dosing interval for INVEGA SUSTENNA, if possible. If administering a strong inducer is necessary, consider managing the patient using paliperidone extended release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.6 Switching from Other Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from other antipsychotics to INVEGA SUSTENNA, or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. Switching from Oral Antipsychotics For patients who have never taken oral paliperidone or oral or injectable risperidone, tolerability should be established with oral paliperidone or oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA. Previous oral antipsychotics can be gradually discontinued at the time of initiation of treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA. Recommended initiation of INVEGA SUSTENNA is with a dose of 234 mg on treatment day 1 and 156 mg one week later, both administered in the deltoid muscle [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Patients previously stabilized on different doses of INVEGA Extended-Release tablets can attain similar paliperidone steady-state exposure during maintenance treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA monthly doses as depicted in Table 4. Table 4: Doses of INVEGA and INVEGA SUSTENNA Needed to Attain Similar Steady-State Paliperidone Exposure During Maintenance Treatment Formulation INVEGA Extended-Release Tablet INVEGA SUSTENNA Injection Dosing Frequency Once Daily Once every 4 weeks Dose (mg) 12 234 9 156 6 117 3 39–78 Switching from Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics For patients who have never taken oral paliperidone or oral or injectable risperidone, tolerability should be established with oral paliperidone or oral risperidone prior to initiating treatment with INVEGA SUSTENNA. When switching patients currently at steady-state on a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, initiate INVEGA SUSTENNA therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. INVEGA SUSTENNA should then be continued at monthly intervals. The one-week initiation dosing regimen as described in Section 2.2 is not required. See Table 1 above for recommended monthly maintenance dosing. Based on previous clinical history of tolerability and/or efficacy, some patients may benefit from lower or higher maintenance doses within the available strengths (39 mg, 78 mg, 117 mg, 156 mg, and 234 mg). The 39 mg strength was not studied in the long-term schizoaffective disorder study. Monthly maintenance doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . If INVEGA SUSTENNA is discontinued, its prolonged-release characteristics must be considered. As recommended with other antipsychotic medications, the need for continuing existing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) medication should be re-evaluated periodically. 2.7 Instructions for Preparation and Administration Each injection must be administered only by a healthcare professional. The kit contains a prefilled syringe and 2 safety needles (a 1 ½-inch 22 gauge needle and a 1-inch 23 gauge needle) for intramuscular injection. INVEGA SUSTENNA is for single use only. Shake the syringe vigorously for a minimum of 10 seconds to ensure a homogeneous suspension. Select the appropriate needle. For DELTOID injection: If the patient weighs less than 90 kg, use the 1-inch 23 gauge needle (needle with blue colored hub). If the patient weighs 90 kg or more, use the 1 ½-inch 22 gauge needle (needle with gray colored hub). For GLUTEAL injection: Use the 1 ½-inch 22 gauge needle (needle with gray colored hub) regardless of patient's weight. Hold the syringe with the tip cap pointing up. Remove the rubber tip cap with a gentle twisting motion. Peel the safety needle pouch half way open. Grasp the needle sheath using the plastic peel pouch. Hold the syringe pointing up. Attach the safety needle to the syringe using a gentle twisting motion to avoid needle hub cracks or damage. Always check for signs of damage or leaking prior to administration. Pull the needle sheath away from the needle with a straight pull. Do not twist the sheath as the needle may be loosened from the syringe. Bring the syringe with the attached needle in upright position to de-aerate. De-aerate the syringe by moving the plunger rod carefully forward. Inject the entire contents intramuscularly slowly, deep into the selected deltoid or gluteal muscle of the patient. Do not administer by any other route. After the injection is complete, use either thumb or finger of one hand (h1, h2) or a flat surface (h3) to activate the needle protection system. The needle protection system is fully activated when a 'click' is heard. Discard the syringe with needle appropriately. h1 h2 h3 Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure h1 h2 h3",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE INVEGA SUSTENNA (paliperidone palmitate) is indicated for the treatment of: Schizophrenia in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ].

( 1 ),"10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience No cases of overdose were reported in premarketing studies with INVEGA SUSTENNA. Because INVEGA SUSTENNA is to be administered by healthcare professionals, the potential for overdosage by patients is low. While experience with paliperidone overdose is limited, among the few cases of overdose reported in premarketing trials with oral paliperidone, the highest estimated ingestion was 405 mg. Observed signs and symptoms included extrapyramidal symptoms and gait unsteadiness. Other potential signs and symptoms include those resulting from an exaggeration of paliperidone's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and QT prolongation. Torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation have been reported in a patient in the setting of overdose with oral paliperidone. Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. Overdose experience reported with risperidone can be found in the OVERDOSAGE section of the risperidone package insert. 10.2 Management of Overdosage Contact a Certified Poison Control Center for the most up to date information on the management of INVEGA SUSTENNA overdosage (1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org). Provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdosage. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures. There is no specific antidote to paliperidone. Consider the prolonged-release characteristics of INVEGA SUSTENNA and the long apparent half-life of paliperidone when assessing treatment needs and recovery.","Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",PALIPERIDONE PALMITATE

May increase to dosages above 1.5 mg twice daily at intervals of at least one week. ( 2.4 ) Oral Solution: Can be administered directly from calibrated oral dosing syringe or mixed with beverage (water, coffee, orange juice, or low-fat milk). ( 2.6 ) M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets: Open the blister only when ready to administer, and immediately place tablet on the tongue. Can be swallowed with or without liquid. ( 2.7 ) 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults Usual Initial Dose RISPERDAL can be administered once or twice daily. Initial dosing is 2 mg per day. May increase the dose at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 to 2 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg per day. In some patients, slower titration may be appropriate. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 mg to 16 mg per day. However, doses above 6 mg per day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg per day has not been evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Adolescents The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 3 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of adolescent patients with schizophrenia at doses between 1 mg to 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 3 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily. Maintenance Therapy While it is unknown how long a patient with schizophrenia should remain on RISPERDAL, the effectiveness of RISPERDAL 2 mg per day to 8 mg per day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in adult patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Both adult and adolescent patients who respond acutely should generally be maintained on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that after an interval off RISPERDAL, the initial titration schedule should be followed. Switching From Other Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching schizophrenic patients from other antipsychotics to RISPERDAL, or treating patients with concomitant antipsychotics. 2.2 Bipolar Mania Usual Dose Adults The initial dose range is 2 mg to 3 mg per day. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 mg per day. The effective dose range is 1 mg to 6 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, short-term (3 week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 mg to 6 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2 , 14.3) ] . RISPERDAL doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied. Pediatrics The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to the recommended target dose of 1 mg to 2.5 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of pediatric patients with bipolar mania at doses between 0.5 mg and 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 2.5 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily. Maintenance Therapy There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer-term management of a patient who improves during treatment of an acute manic episode with RISPERDAL. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the use of RISPERDAL in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond 3 weeks). The physician who elects to use RISPERDAL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient. 2.3 Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder – Pediatrics (Children and Adolescents) The dosage of RISPERDAL should be individualized according to the response and tolerability of the patient. The total daily dose of RISPERDAL can be administered once daily, or half the total daily dose can be administered twice daily. For patients with body weight less than 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.25 mg per day. For patients with body weight greater than or equal to 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.5 mg per day. After a minimum of four days, the dose may be increased to the recommended dose of 0.5 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg and 1.0 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. Maintain this dose for a minimum of 14 days. In patients not achieving sufficient clinical response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 2 weeks or greater, in increments of 0.25 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg, or increments of 0.5 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. The effective dose range is 0.5 mg to 3 mg per day. No dosing data are available for children who weigh less than 15 kg. Once sufficient clinical response has been achieved and maintained, consider gradually lowering the dose to achieve the optimal balance of efficacy and safety. The physician who elects to use RISPERDAL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from a once-daily dose administered at bedtime or administering half the daily dose twice daily, or a reduction of the dose. 2.4 Dosing in Patients with Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment For patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr< 30 mL/min) or hepatic impairment (10–15 points on Child Pugh System), the initial starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily. The dose may be increased in increments of 0.5 mg or less, administered twice daily. For doses above 1.5 mg twice daily, increase in intervals of one week or greater [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 and 8.7) ]. 2.5 Dose Adjustments for Specific Drug Interactions When RISPERDAL is co-administered with enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine), the dose of RISPERDAL should be increased up to double the patient's usual dose. It may be necessary to decrease the RISPERDAL dose when enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine are discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Similar effect may be expected with co-administration of RISPERDAL with other enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital). When fluoxetine or paroxetine is co-administered with RISPERDAL, the dose of RISPERDAL should be reduced. The RISPERDAL dose should not exceed 8 mg per day in adults when co-administered with these drugs. When initiating therapy, RISPERDAL should be titrated slowly. It may be necessary to increase the RISPERDAL dose when enzyme inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine are discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.6 Administration of RISPERDAL Oral Solution RISPERDAL Oral Solution can be administered directly from the calibrated oral dosing syringe, or can be mixed with a beverage prior to administration. RISPERDAL Oral Solution is compatible in the following beverages: water, coffee, orange juice, and low-fat milk; it is NOT compatible with either cola or tea. 2.7 Directions for Use of RISPERDAL M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets Tablet Accessing RISPERDAL M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg RISPERDAL M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg are supplied in blister packs of 4 tablets each.

Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older Weighing 50 kg or More Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg once daily. The once daily dosage may be adjusted in increments of 1000 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg/day once daily. Administration KEPPRA XR is administered once daily. KEPPRA XR tablets should be swallowed whole. The tablets should not be chewed, broken, or crushed. 2.2 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment KEPPRA XR dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this, an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula: CLcr= [140-age (years)] × weight (kg) -------------------------------------- (× 0.85 for female patients) 72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL) Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows: CLcr (mL/min/1.73m 2 )= CLcr (mL/min) ------------------------- × 1.73 BSA subject (m 2 ) Table 1: Dosage Adjustment Regimen for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Group Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73m 2 ) Dosage (mg) Frequency Normal > 80 1000 to 3000 Every 24 hours Mild 50 – 80 1000 to 2000 Every 24 hours Moderate 30 – 50 500 to 1500 Every 24 hours Severe < 30 500 to 1000 Every 24 hours 2.3 Discontinuation of KEPPRA XR Avoid abrupt withdrawal from KEPPRA XR in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ].",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE KEPPRA XR ® is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 12 years of age and older.

The highest known dose of oral immediate-release KEPPRA received in the clinical development program was 6000 mg/day. Other than drowsiness, there were no adverse reactions in the few known cases of overdose in clinical trials. Cases of somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression and coma were observed with immediate-release KEPPRA overdoses in postmarketing use. 10.2 Management of Overdose There is no specific antidote for overdose with KEPPRA XR. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient's clinical status. A Certified Poison Control Center should be contacted for up to date information on the management of overdose with KEPPRA XR. 10.3 Hemodialysis Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of levetiracetam (approximately 50% in 4 hours) and should be considered in cases of overdose.

( 2.6 ) M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets: Open the blister only when ready to administer, and immediately place tablet on the tongue. Can be swallowed with or without liquid. ( 2.7 ) 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults Usual Initial Dose RISPERDAL can be administered once or twice daily. Initial dosing is 2 mg per day. May increase the dose at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 to 2 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg per day. In some patients, slower titration may be appropriate. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 mg to 16 mg per day. However, doses above 6 mg per day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg per day has not been evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Adolescents The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 3 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of adolescent patients with schizophrenia at doses between 1 mg to 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 3 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily. Maintenance Therapy While it is unknown how long a patient with schizophrenia should remain on RISPERDAL, the effectiveness of RISPERDAL 2 mg per day to 8 mg per day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in adult patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Both adult and adolescent patients who respond acutely should generally be maintained on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that after an interval off RISPERDAL, the initial titration schedule should be followed. Switching From Other Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching schizophrenic patients from other antipsychotics to RISPERDAL, or treating patients with concomitant antipsychotics. 2.2 Bipolar Mania Usual Dose Adults The initial dose range is 2 mg to 3 mg per day. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 mg per day. The effective dose range is 1 mg to 6 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, short-term (3 week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 mg to 6 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2 , 14.3) ] . RISPERDAL doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied. Pediatrics The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to the recommended target dose of 1 mg to 2.5 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of pediatric patients with bipolar mania at doses between 0.5 mg and 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 2.5 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily. Maintenance Therapy There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer-term management of a patient who improves during treatment of an acute manic episode with RISPERDAL. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the use of RISPERDAL in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond 3 weeks). The physician who elects to use RISPERDAL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient. 2.3 Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder – Pediatrics (Children and Adolescents) The dosage of RISPERDAL should be individualized according to the response and tolerability of the patient. The total daily dose of RISPERDAL can be administered once daily, or half the total daily dose can be administered twice daily. For patients with body weight less than 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.25 mg per day. For patients with body weight greater than or equal to 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.5 mg per day. After a minimum of four days, the dose may be increased to the recommended dose of 0.5 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg and 1.0 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. Maintain this dose for a minimum of 14 days. In patients not achieving sufficient clinical response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 2 weeks or greater, in increments of 0.25 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg, or increments of 0.5 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. The effective dose range is 0.5 mg to 3 mg per day. No dosing data are available for children who weigh less than 15 kg. Once sufficient clinical response has been achieved and maintained, consider gradually lowering the dose to achieve the optimal balance of efficacy and safety. The physician who elects to use RISPERDAL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from a once-daily dose administered at bedtime or administering half the daily dose twice daily, or a reduction of the dose. 2.4 Dosing in Patients with Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment For patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr< 30 mL/min) or hepatic impairment (10–15 points on Child Pugh System), the initial starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily. The dose may be increased in increments of 0.5 mg or less, administered twice daily. For doses above 1.5 mg twice daily, increase in intervals of one week or greater [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 and 8.7) ]. 2.5 Dose Adjustments for Specific Drug Interactions When RISPERDAL is co-administered with enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine), the dose of RISPERDAL should be increased up to double the patient's usual dose. It may be necessary to decrease the RISPERDAL dose when enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine are discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Similar effect may be expected with co-administration of RISPERDAL with other enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital). When fluoxetine or paroxetine is co-administered with RISPERDAL, the dose of RISPERDAL should be reduced. The RISPERDAL dose should not exceed 8 mg per day in adults when co-administered with these drugs. When initiating therapy, RISPERDAL should be titrated slowly. It may be necessary to increase the RISPERDAL dose when enzyme inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine are discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.6 Administration of RISPERDAL Oral Solution RISPERDAL Oral Solution can be administered directly from the calibrated oral dosing syringe, or can be mixed with a beverage prior to administration. RISPERDAL Oral Solution is compatible in the following beverages: water, coffee, orange juice, and low-fat milk; it is NOT compatible with either cola or tea. 2.7 Directions for Use of RISPERDAL M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets Tablet Accessing RISPERDAL M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg RISPERDAL M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg are supplied in blister packs of 4 tablets each.

In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 240 mg, was associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, prolonged QT, and widened QRS. Another case, involving an estimated overdose of 36 mg, was associated with a seizure. Postmarketing experience includes reports of acute RISPERDAL overdosage, with estimated doses of up to 360 mg. In general, the most frequently reported signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Other adverse reactions reported since market introduction related to RISPERDAL overdose include prolonged QT interval and convulsions. Torsade de pointes has been reported in association with combined overdose of RISPERDAL and paroxetine. 10.2 Management of Overdosage For the most up to date information on the management of RISPERDAL overdosage, contact a certified poison control center (1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org). Provide supportive care including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdosage. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures.

In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 240 mg, was associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, prolonged QT, and widened QRS. Another case, involving an estimated overdose of 36 mg, was associated with a seizure. Postmarketing experience includes reports of acute RISPERDAL overdosage, with estimated doses of up to 360 mg. In general, the most frequently reported signs and symptoms are those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Other adverse reactions reported since market introduction related to RISPERDAL overdose include prolonged QT interval and convulsions. Torsade de pointes has been reported in association with combined overdose of RISPERDAL and paroxetine. 10.2 Management of Overdosage For the most up to date information on the management of RISPERDAL overdosage, contact a certified poison control center (1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org). Provide supportive care including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdosage. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures.

May increase to dosages above 1.5 mg twice daily at intervals of at least one week. ( 2.4 ) Oral Solution: Can be administered directly from calibrated oral dosing syringe or mixed with beverage (water, coffee, orange juice, or low-fat milk). ( 2.6 ) M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets: Open the blister only when ready to administer, and immediately place tablet on the tongue. Can be swallowed with or without liquid. ( 2.7 ) 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults Usual Initial Dose RISPERDAL can be administered once or twice daily. Initial dosing is 2 mg per day. May increase the dose at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 to 2 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg per day. In some patients, slower titration may be appropriate. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 mg to 16 mg per day. However, doses above 6 mg per day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg per day has not been evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Adolescents The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 3 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of adolescent patients with schizophrenia at doses between 1 mg to 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 3 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily. Maintenance Therapy While it is unknown how long a patient with schizophrenia should remain on RISPERDAL, the effectiveness of RISPERDAL 2 mg per day to 8 mg per day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in adult patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Both adult and adolescent patients who respond acutely should generally be maintained on their effective dose beyond the acute episode. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that after an interval off RISPERDAL, the initial titration schedule should be followed. Switching From Other Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching schizophrenic patients from other antipsychotics to RISPERDAL, or treating patients with concomitant antipsychotics. 2.2 Bipolar Mania Usual Dose Adults The initial dose range is 2 mg to 3 mg per day. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 mg per day. The effective dose range is 1 mg to 6 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, short-term (3 week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 mg to 6 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2 , 14.3) ] . RISPERDAL doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied. Pediatrics The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to the recommended target dose of 1 mg to 2.5 mg per day. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of pediatric patients with bipolar mania at doses between 0.5 mg and 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 2.5 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily. Maintenance Therapy There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer-term management of a patient who improves during treatment of an acute manic episode with RISPERDAL. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the use of RISPERDAL in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond 3 weeks). The physician who elects to use RISPERDAL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient. 2.3 Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder – Pediatrics (Children and Adolescents) The dosage of RISPERDAL should be individualized according to the response and tolerability of the patient. The total daily dose of RISPERDAL can be administered once daily, or half the total daily dose can be administered twice daily. For patients with body weight less than 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.25 mg per day. For patients with body weight greater than or equal to 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.5 mg per day. After a minimum of four days, the dose may be increased to the recommended dose of 0.5 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg and 1.0 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. Maintain this dose for a minimum of 14 days. In patients not achieving sufficient clinical response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 2 weeks or greater, in increments of 0.25 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg, or increments of 0.5 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg. The effective dose range is 0.5 mg to 3 mg per day. No dosing data are available for children who weigh less than 15 kg. Once sufficient clinical response has been achieved and maintained, consider gradually lowering the dose to achieve the optimal balance of efficacy and safety. The physician who elects to use RISPERDAL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from a once-daily dose administered at bedtime or administering half the daily dose twice daily, or a reduction of the dose. 2.4 Dosing in Patients with Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment For patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr< 30 mL/min) or hepatic impairment (10–15 points on Child Pugh System), the initial starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily. The dose may be increased in increments of 0.5 mg or less, administered twice daily. For doses above 1.5 mg twice daily, increase in intervals of one week or greater [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 and 8.7) ]. 2.5 Dose Adjustments for Specific Drug Interactions When RISPERDAL is co-administered with enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine), the dose of RISPERDAL should be increased up to double the patient's usual dose. It may be necessary to decrease the RISPERDAL dose when enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine are discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Similar effect may be expected with co-administration of RISPERDAL with other enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital). When fluoxetine or paroxetine is co-administered with RISPERDAL, the dose of RISPERDAL should be reduced. The RISPERDAL dose should not exceed 8 mg per day in adults when co-administered with these drugs. When initiating therapy, RISPERDAL should be titrated slowly. It may be necessary to increase the RISPERDAL dose when enzyme inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine are discontinued [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.6 Administration of RISPERDAL Oral Solution RISPERDAL Oral Solution can be administered directly from the calibrated oral dosing syringe, or can be mixed with a beverage prior to administration. RISPERDAL Oral Solution is compatible in the following beverages: water, coffee, orange juice, and low-fat milk; it is NOT compatible with either cola or tea. 2.7 Directions for Use of RISPERDAL M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets Tablet Accessing RISPERDAL M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg RISPERDAL M-TAB Orally Disintegrating Tablets 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg are supplied in blister packs of 4 tablets each.

Patients may self-inject when deemed appropriate and if they receive medical follow-up, as necessary. Patients should not self-administer until they receive proper training in how to prepare and administer the correct dose. Administer injections subcutaneously in the thigh, abdomen or outer area of the upper arm. The Enbrel devices are not made with natural rubber latex. The Enbrel (etanercept) ""Instructions for Use"" insert for each presentation contains more detailed instructions on injection site selection and the preparation of Enbrel. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Prefilled Syringe For a more comfortable injection, leave Enbrel prefilled syringes at room temperature for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the needle cover while allowing the prefilled syringe to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. When using the Enbrel single-dose prefilled syringe, check to see if the amount of liquid in the prefilled syringe falls between the two purple fill level indicator lines on the syringe. If the syringe does not have the right amount of liquid, DO NOT USE THAT SYRINGE. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Prefilled SureClick Autoinjector Leave the autoinjector at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the needle cover while allowing the prefilled syringe to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Vial For a more comfortable injection, leave Enbrel vial(s) at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the vial cap while allowing the vial to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. When using the Enbrel single-dose vial, administer the correct dose of solution using the following recommended materials: A 1 mL Luer-Lock syringe. A withdrawal needle with Luer-Lock connection, sterile, 22-gauge, length 1 ½ inch. An injection needle with Luer-Lock connection, sterile, 27-gauge, length ½ inch. Two vials may be required to administer the total prescribed dose. Use the same syringe for each vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions. Preparation of Enbrel Lyophilized Powder in a Multiple-dose Vial Enbrel lyophilized powder should be reconstituted aseptically with 1 mL of the supplied Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol), giving a solution of 1 mL containing 25 mg of Enbrel. A vial adapter is supplied for use when reconstituting the lyophilized powder. However, the vial adapter should not be used if multiple doses are going to be withdrawn from the vial. If the vial will be used for multiple doses, a 25-gauge needle should be used for reconstituting and withdrawing Enbrel, and the supplied ""Mixing Date:"" sticker should be attached to the vial and the date of reconstitution entered. Reconstituted solution must be refrigerated at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C) and used within 14 days. Discard reconstituted solution after 14 days because product stability and sterility cannot be assured after 14 days. DO NOT store reconstituted Enbrel solution at room temperature. For a more comfortable injection, leave the Enbrel dose tray at room temperature for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting. If using the vial adapter, twist the vial adapter onto the diluent syringe. Then, place the vial adapter over the Enbrel vial and insert the vial adapter into the vial stopper. Push down on the plunger to inject the diluent into the Enbrel vial. If using a 25-gauge needle to reconstitute and withdraw Enbrel, the diluent should be injected very slowly into the Enbrel vial. It is normal for some foaming to occur. Keeping the diluent syringe in place, gently swirl the contents of the Enbrel vial during dissolution. To avoid excessive foaming, do not shake or vigorously agitate. Generally, dissolution of Enbrel takes less than 10 minutes. Do not use the solution if discolored or cloudy, or if particulate matter remains. Withdraw the correct dose of reconstituted solution into the syringe. Some foam or bubbles may remain in the vial. Remove the syringe from the vial adapter or remove the 25-gauge needle from the syringe. Attach a 27-gauge needle to inject Enbrel. The contents of one vial of Enbrel solution should not be mixed with, or transferred into, the contents of another vial of Enbrel. No other medications should be added to solutions containing Enbrel, and do not reconstitute Enbrel with other diluents. Do not filter reconstituted solution during preparation or administration. Preparation of Enbrel Mini ® single-dose prefilled cartridge using the AutoTouch ® reusable autoinjector Leave Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the purple cap while allowing the cartridge to reach room temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. To use AutoTouch reusable autoinjector, open the door by pushing the door button and inserting Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge into AutoTouch. When inserted correctly, Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge will slide freely and completely into the door.

SYNTHROID,N/A,N/A,Respiratory failure,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer once daily, preferably on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. ( 2.1 ) Administer at least 4 hours before or after drugs that are known to interfere with absorption. ( 2.1 ) Evaluate the need for dose adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect absorption. ( 2.1 ) Advise patients to stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels. ( 2.2 ) Starting dose depends on a variety of factors, including age, body weight, cardiovascular status, and concomitant medications. Peak therapeutic effect may not be attained for 4-6 weeks. ( 2.2 ) See full prescribing information for dosing in specific patient populations. ( 2.3 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and/or T4 as well as clinical status. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Administer SYNTHROID as a single daily dose, on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours before or after drugs known to interfere with SYNTHROID absorption [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Evaluate the need for dosage adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect SYNTHROID absorption [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 and 2.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.9 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Administer SYNTHROID to pediatric patients who cannot swallow intact tablets by crushing the tablet, suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5 to 10 mL) of water and immediately administering the suspension by spoon or dropper. Ensure the patient ingests the full amount of the suspension. Do not store the suspension. Do not administer in foods that decrease absorption of SYNTHROID, such as soybean-based infant formula [see Drug Interactions ( 7.9 ) ] . 2.2 Important Considerations for Dosing The dosage of SYNTHROID for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dosage adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . For adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is not a reliable measure of SYNTHROID dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate SYNTHROID dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.10 )]. The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of SYNTHROID may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Titration Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Table 1. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Adults* Patient Population Starting Dosage Dosage Titration Based on Serum TSH or Free-T4 Adults diagnosed with hypothyroidism Full replacement dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day. Some patients require a lower starting dose. Titrate dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Adults at risk for atrial fibrillation or with underlying cardiac disease Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) Titrate dosage every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Geriatric patients Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) * Dosages greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily dosages greater than 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Table 2. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Ag e Starting Daily Dos ag e Per Kg Body Weight * 0-3 months 10-15 mcg/kg/day 3-6 months 8-10 mcg/kg/day 6-12 months 6-8 mcg/kg/day 1-5 years 5-6 mcg/kg/day 6-12 years 4-5 mcg/kg/day Greater than 12 years but growth and puberty incomplete 2-3 mcg/kg/day Growth and puberty complete 1.6 mcg/kg/day * Adjust dosage based on clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ] . Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached. Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. The recommended daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pregnant patients is described in Table 3. Table 3. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients Patient Population Starting Dosage Dose Adjustment and Titration Pre-existing primary hypothyroidism with serum TSH above normal trimester-specific range Pre-pregnancy dosage may increase during pregnancy Increase SYNTHROID dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Monitor TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. Reduce SYNTHROID dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery. Monitor serum TSH 4 to 8 weeks postpartum. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH ≥ 10 mIU per liter) 1.6 mcg/kg/day Monitor serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust SYNTHROID dosage until serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH < 10 mIU per liter) 1.0 mcg/kg/day TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Adult and Pediatric Patients The SYNTHROID dosage is based on the target level of TSH suppression for the stage and clinical status of thyroid cancer. 2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T4, and T3, resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Drug Interactions ( 7.10 )]. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of SYNTHROID may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dosage. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dosage, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient’s clinical status. Pediatric Patients In patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in pediatric patients as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dosage stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. The general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level. TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of SYNTHROID therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the patient is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of SYNTHROID [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypothyroidism SYNTHROID is indicated in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates, as a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

Reconstitute REBLOZYL with Sterile Water for Injection, USP only. Table 5: Reconstitution Volumes Vial Size Amount of Sterile Water for Injection, USP required for reconstitution Final Concentration Deliverable Volume 25 mg vial 0.68 mL 25 mg/0.5 mL (50 mg/mL) 0.5 mL 75 mg vial 1.6 mL 75 mg/1.5 mL 1.5 mL (50 mg/mL) Reconstitute the number of REBLOZYL vials to achieve the appropriate dose based on the patient’s weight. Use a syringe with suitable graduations for reconstitution to ensure accurate dosage. Reconstitution Instructions 1. Reconstitute with Sterile Water for Injection, USP using volumes described in Table 5 (Reconstitution Volumes) with the stream directed onto the lyophilized powder. Allow to stand for one minute. 2. Discard the needle and syringe used for reconstitution. The needle and syringe used for reconstitution should not be used for subcutaneous injections. 3. Gently swirl the vial in a circular motion for 30 seconds. Stop swirling and let the vial sit in an upright position for 30 seconds. 4. Inspect the vial for undissolved particles in the solution. If undissolved powder is observed, repeat step 3 until the powder is completely dissolved. 5. Invert the vial and gently swirl in an inverted position for 30 seconds. Bring the vial back to the upright position, and let it sit for 30 seconds. 6. Repeat step 5 seven more times to ensure complete reconstitution of material on the sides of the vial. 7. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. REBLOZYL is a colorless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution which is free of foreign particulate matter. Do not use if undissolved product or foreign particulate matter are observed. 8. If the reconstituted solution is not used immediately: • Store at room temperature at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) in the original vial for up to 8 hours. Discard if not used within 8 hours of reconstitution. • Alternatively, store refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours in the original vial. Remove from refrigerated condition 15-30 minutes prior to injection to allow solution to reach room temperature for a more comfortable injection. Discard if not used within 24 hours of reconstitution. • Do not freeze the reconstituted solution. Discard any unused portion. Do not pool unused portions from the vials. Do not administer more than 1 dose from a vial. Do not mix with other medications. Instructions for Subcutaneous Administration Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 50 mg/mL solution required for the patient. Slowly withdraw the dosing volume of the reconstituted REBLOZYL solution from the single-dose vial(s) into a syringe. Divide doses requiring larger reconstituted volumes (i.e., greater than 1.2 mL) into separate similar volume injections and inject into separate sites. If multiple injections are required, use a new syringe and needle for each subcutaneous injection. Administer the injection subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh, and/or abdomen.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE REBLOZYL is an erythroid maturation agent indicated for the treatment of: • Anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions ( 1.1 ). • Anemia without previous erythropoiesis stimulating agent use (ESA-naïve) in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who may require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions ( 1.2 ). • Anemia failing an erythropoiesis stimulating agent and requiring 2 or more RBC units over 8 weeks in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) or with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T) ( 1.3 ). • Limitations of Use: REBLOZYL is not indicated for use as a substitute for RBC transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia ( 1.4 ). 1.1 Beta Thalassemia REBLOZYL is indicated for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. 1.2 Myelodysplastic Syndromes Associated Anemia REBLOZYL is indicated for the treatment of anemia without previous erythropoiesis stimulating agent use (ESA-naïve) in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who may require regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. 1.3 Myelodysplastic Syndromes with Ring Sideroblasts or Myelodysplastic/ Myeloproliferative Neoplasm with Ring Sideroblasts and Thrombocytosis Associated Anemia REBLOZYL is indicated for the treatment of anemia failing an erythropoiesis stimulating agent and requiring 2 or more red blood cell units over 8 weeks in adult patients with very low- to intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) or with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T). 1.4 Limitations of Use REBLOZYL is not indicated for use as a substitute for RBC transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia.,N/A,Celgene Corporation,LUSPATERCEPT

A patient may self-inject HUMIRA or a caregiver may inject HUMIRA using either the HUMIRA Pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. HUMIRA can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the HUMIRA Pen, prefilled syringe, or single-dose institutional use vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. HUMIRA does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. NOTE: Instruct patients sensitive to latex not to handle the needle cover of the HUMIRA 40 mg/0.8 mL Pen and 40 mg/0.8 mL, 20 mg/0.4 mL and 10 mg/0.2 mL prefilled syringe because it may contain natural rubber latex [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 ) ] . Instruct patients using the HUMIRA Pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ] . Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. The HUMIRA single-dose institutional use vial is for administration within an institutional setting only, such as a hospital, physician’s office or clinic. Withdraw the dose using a sterile needle and syringe and administer promptly by a healthcare provider within an institutional setting. Only administer one dose per vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE HUMIRA is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker indicated for: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) ( 1.1 ): reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA.

VENCLEXTA,67,801,Lymphadenopathy,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION See Full Prescribing Information for recommended VENCLEXTA dosages. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Take VENCLEXTA tablets orally once daily with a meal and water. Do not chew, crush, or break tablets. ( 2.8 ) Provide prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome. ( 2.1 , 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Safety Information Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA dosing begins with a 5-week ramp-up. The 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule is designed to gradually reduce tumor burden (debulk) and decrease the risk of TLS. VENCLEXTA 5-week Dose Ramp-Up Schedule Administer VENCLEXTA according to the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule to the recommended dosage of 400 mg orally once daily as shown in Table 1 . Table 1. Dosing Schedule for 5-Week Ramp-up Phase for Patients with CLL/SLL VENCLEXTA Oral Daily Dose Week 1 20 mg Week 2 50 mg Week 3 100 mg Week 4 200 mg Week 5 and beyond 400 mg The CLL/SLL Starting Pack provides the first 4 weeks of VENCLEXTA according to the ramp-up schedule [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . In Combination with Obinutuzumab Start obinutuzumab administration at 100 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by 900 mg on Cycle 1 Day 2. Administer 1000 mg on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle for a total of 6 cycles. Refer to the obinutuzumab prescribing information for additional dosing information. On Cycle 1 Day 22, start VENCLEXTA according to the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule (see Table 1 ). After completing the ramp-up phase on Cycle 2 Day 28, continue VENCLEXTA at a dose of 400 mg orally once daily from Cycle 3 Day 1 until the last day of Cycle 12. In Combination with Rituximab Start rituximab administration after the patient has completed the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule for VENCLEXTA (see Table 1 ) and has received VENCLEXTA at the recommended dosage of 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days. Administer rituximab on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles, at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 intravenously for Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m 2 intravenously for Cycles 2-6. Continue VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab. Refer to the rituximab prescribing information for additional dosing information. Monotherapy The recommended dosage of VENCLEXTA is 400 mg once daily after completion of the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule (see Table 1 ). Continue VENCLEXTA until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Acute Myeloid Leukemia The recommended dosage and ramp-up of VENCLEXTA depends upon the combination agent. Follow the dosing schedule, including the 3-day or 4-day dose ramp-up, as shown in Table 2.

Refer to Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Prescribing Information for azacitidine, decitabine, or cytarabine for additional dosing information. 2.4 Risk Assessment and Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome Patients treated with VENCLEXTA may develop tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Refer to the appropriate section below for specific details on management. Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of TLS and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week ramp-up phase. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase. TLS can also occur upon resumption of VENCLEXTA following a dosage interruption. See Table 4 and Table 5 for dose modifications of VENCLEXTA after interruption. The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, particularly reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] <80 mL/min) and tumor burden; splenomegaly may also increase the risk of TLS. Perform tumor burden assessments, including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scan), assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) in all patients and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Table 3 below describes the recommended TLS prophylaxis and monitoring during VENCLEXTA treatment based on tumor burden determination from clinical trial data. Consider all patient comorbidities before final determination of prophylaxis and monitoring schedule. Reassess the risk of TLS when reinitiating VENCLEXTA after a dosage interruption lasting more than 1 week during the ramp-up phase, or more than 2 weeks after completion of ramp-up. Institute prophylaxis and monitoring as needed. Table 3.

Acute Myeloid Leukemia All patients should have white blood cell count less than 25 × 10 9 /L prior to initiation of VENCLEXTA. Cytoreduction prior to treatment may be required. Prior to first VENCLEXTA dose, provide all patients with prophylactic measures including adequate hydration and anti-hyperuricemic agents and continue during ramp-up phase. Assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. Monitor blood chemistries for TLS at pre-dose, 6 to 8 hours after each new dose during ramp-up, and 24 hours after reaching final dose. For patients with risk factors for TLS (e.g., circulating blasts, high burden of leukemia involvement in bone marrow, elevated pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels, or reduced renal function), consider additional measures, including increased laboratory monitoring and reducing VENCLEXTA starting dose. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma The recommended dosage modifications for VENCLEXTA for adverse reactions are provided in Table 4 and the recommended dose reductions for VENCLEXTA for adverse reactions are provided in Table 5. For patients having a dosage interruption lasting more than 1 week during the ramp-up phase, or more than 2 weeks after completion of ramp-up, reassess for risk of TLS to determine if reinitiation with a reduced dose is necessary (e.g., all or some levels of the dose ramp-up schedule) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )].

AMPHOTERICIN B,67,801,Liver injury,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis Naproxen tablets 250 mg (one-half tablet) 500 mg twice daily Naproxen sodium tablets 275 mg (one-half tablet) 550 mg twice daily The dose may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/ day for up to 6 months. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen tablets may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate. Recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis Recommended starting dose 550 mg of naproxen sodium as naproxen sodium tablets followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Naproxen sodium tablets are recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Acute Gout Recommended starting dose 750 mg of naproxen tablets followed by 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium tablets may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg followed by 275 mg every 8 hours. 2.1 General Dosing Instructions Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ]. After observing the response to initial therapy with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs. Naproxen-containing products such as naproxen and naproxen sodium tablets, and other naproxen products should not be used concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion. 2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dosages of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Recommended dosages for naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets Naproxen tablets 250 mg (one half tablet) 500 mg twice daily Naproxen sodium tablets 275 mg (one half tablet) 550 mg (naproxen 500 mg with 50 mg sodium) twice daily During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response. In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk. 2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen solid-oral dosage forms may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate for weight-based dosing and due to the need for dose flexibility in children. In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ]. The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. 2.4 Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis The recommended starting dose of naproxen sodium tablets is 550 mg followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg (one half of a 550 mg tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg (two and one-half tablets) of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Because the sodium salt of naproxen is more rapidly absorbed, naproxen sodium tablets is recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Naproxen tablets may also be used. The recommended starting dose of naproxen tablets is 500 mg followed by 250 mg (one half of a 500 mg naproxen tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The total daily dose should not exceed 1250 mg of naproxen. 2.5 Acute Gout The recommended starting dose is 750 mg (one and one-half tablets) of naproxen tablets followed by 250 mg (one-half tablet) every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium tablets may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg (one and one-half tablets) followed by 275 mg (one-half tablet) every 8 hours. 2.6 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Naproxen Different dose strengths and formulations (e.g., tablets, suspension) of naproxen are not interchangeable. This difference should be taken into consideration when changing strengths or formulations.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are indicated for: the relief of the signs and symptoms of: • rheumatoid arthritis • osteoarthritis • ankylosing spondylitis • Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are also indicated for: the relief of signs and symptoms of: • tendonitis • bursitis • acute gout the management of: • pain • primary dysmenorrhea Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indicated for: the relief of the signs and symptoms of: • rheumatoid arthritis • osteoarthritis • ankylosing spondylitis • polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are also indicated for: the relief of signs and symptoms of: • tendonitis • bursitis • acute gout the management of: • pain • primary dysmenorrhea,"10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) ].Because naproxen sodium may be rapidly absorbed, high and early blood levels should be anticipated. A few patients have experienced convulsions, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug-related. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 , 5.6 ) ]. Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

PREDNISONE,67,801,Liver injury,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT ® (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing’s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1¼ to 1½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1.

Miscellaneous Tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement","WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

( 2.1 ) Administer at least 4 hours before or after drugs that are known to interfere with absorption. ( 2.1 ) Evaluate the need for dose adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect absorption. ( 2.1 ) Advise patients to stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels. ( 2.2 ) Starting dose depends on a variety of factors, including age, body weight, cardiovascular status, and concomitant medications. Peak therapeutic effect may not be attained for 4-6 weeks. ( 2.2 ) See full prescribing information for dosing in specific patient populations. ( 2.3 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and/or T4 as well as clinical status. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Administer SYNTHROID as a single daily dose, on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours before or after drugs known to interfere with SYNTHROID absorption [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Evaluate the need for dosage adjustments when regularly administering within one hour of certain foods that may affect SYNTHROID absorption [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 and 2.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.9 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Administer SYNTHROID to pediatric patients who cannot swallow intact tablets by crushing the tablet, suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5 to 10 mL) of water and immediately administering the suspension by spoon or dropper. Ensure the patient ingests the full amount of the suspension. Do not store the suspension. Do not administer in foods that decrease absorption of SYNTHROID, such as soybean-based infant formula [see Drug Interactions ( 7.9 ) ] . 2.2 Important Considerations for Dosing The dosage of SYNTHROID for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dosage adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . For adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is not a reliable measure of SYNTHROID dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate SYNTHROID dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.10 )]. The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of SYNTHROID may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Titration Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Table 1. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Adults* Patient Population Starting Dosage Dosage Titration Based on Serum TSH or Free-T4 Adults diagnosed with hypothyroidism Full replacement dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day. Some patients require a lower starting dose. Titrate dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Adults at risk for atrial fibrillation or with underlying cardiac disease Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) Titrate dosage every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is euthyroid. Geriatric patients Lower starting dose (less than 1.6 mcg/kg/day) * Dosages greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily dosages greater than 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . Table 2. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Ag e Starting Daily Dos ag e Per Kg Body Weight * 0-3 months 10-15 mcg/kg/day 3-6 months 8-10 mcg/kg/day 6-12 months 6-8 mcg/kg/day 1-5 years 5-6 mcg/kg/day 6-12 years 4-5 mcg/kg/day Greater than 12 years but growth and puberty incomplete 2-3 mcg/kg/day Growth and puberty complete 1.6 mcg/kg/day * Adjust dosage based on clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ] . Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached. Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. The recommended daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pregnant patients is described in Table 3. Table 3. SYNTHROID Dosing Guidelines for Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients Patient Population Starting Dosage Dose Adjustment and Titration Pre-existing primary hypothyroidism with serum TSH above normal trimester-specific range Pre-pregnancy dosage may increase during pregnancy Increase SYNTHROID dosage by 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Monitor TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. Reduce SYNTHROID dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery. Monitor serum TSH 4 to 8 weeks postpartum. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH ≥ 10 mIU per liter) 1.6 mcg/kg/day Monitor serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust SYNTHROID dosage until serum TSH is within normal trimester-specific range. New onset hypothyroidism (TSH < 10 mIU per liter) 1.0 mcg/kg/day TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Adult and Pediatric Patients The SYNTHROID dosage is based on the target level of TSH suppression for the stage and clinical status of thyroid cancer. 2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T4, and T3, resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Drug Interactions ( 7.10 )]. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of SYNTHROID may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dosage. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dosage, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient’s clinical status. Pediatric Patients In patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in pediatric patients as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dosage stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. The general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level. TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of SYNTHROID therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the patient is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of SYNTHROID [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypothyroidism SYNTHROID is indicated in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates, as a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

PREDNISONE,78,801,Hip arthroplasty,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT ® (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing’s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1¼ to 1½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1. Endocrine Disorders Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (hydrocortisone or cortisone is the first choice; synthetic analogs may be used in conjunction with mineralocorticoids where applicable; in infancy mineralocorticoid supplementation is of particular importance) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hypercalcemia associated with cancer Nonsuppurative thyroiditis 2.

Miscellaneous Tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement","WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine besylate. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.","10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly a reflex tachycardia. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited. Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine/kg and 100 mg amlodipine/kg in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit.","Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",AMLODIPINE BESYLATE

TEMAZEPAM,78,801,Hip arthroplasty,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION While the recommended usual adult dose is 15 mg before retiring, 7.5 mg may be sufficient for some patients, and others may need 30 mg. In transient insomnia, a 7.5 mg dose may be sufficient to improve sleep latency. In elderly or debilitated patients, it is recommended that therapy be initiated with 7.5 mg until individual responses are determined. Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Temazepam To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue temazepam or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly ( see WARNINGS , Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE : Dependence ).","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Temazepam capsules are indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia (generally 7 to 10 days). For patients with short-term insomnia, instructions in the prescription should indicate that temazepam capsules should be used for short periods of time (7 to 10 days). The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy were 2 weeks in duration with the final formal assessment of sleep latency performed at the end of treatment.","OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal ( see WARNINGS, Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction ). Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage. In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-12222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.",Bryant Ranch Prepack,TEMAZEPAM

AMINOPHYLLINE,N/A,N/A,Malaise,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Considerations: The steady-state serum theophylline concentration is a function of the infusion rate and the rate of theophylline clearance in the individual patient. Because of marked individual differences in the rate of theophylline clearance, the dose required to achieve a serum theophylline concentration in the 10-20 mcg/mL range varies fourfold among otherwise similar patients in the absence of factors known to alter theophylline clearance. For a given population there is no single theophylline dose that will provide both safe and effective serum concentrations for all patients. Administration of the median theophylline dose required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration in a given population may result in either sub-therapeutic or potentially toxic serum theophylline concentrations in individual patients. The dose of theophylline must be individualized on the basis of serum theophylline concentration measurements in order to achieve a dose that will provide maximum potential benefit with minimal risk of adverse effects. When theophylline is used as an acute bronchodilator, the goal of obtaining a therapeutic serum concentration is best accomplished with an intravenous loading dose. Because of rapid distribution into body fluids, the serum concentration (C) obtained from an initial loading dose (LD) is related primarily to the volume of distribution (V), the apparent space into which the drug diffuses: C = LD/V If a mean volume of distribution of about 0.5 L/kg is assumed (actual range is 0.3 to 0.7 L/kg), each mg/kg (ideal body weight) of theophylline administered as a loading dose over 30 minutes results in an average 2 mcg/mL increase in serum theophylline concentration. Therefore, in a patient who has received no theophylline in the previous 24 hours, a loading dose of intravenous theophylline of 4.6 mg/kg (5.7 mg/kg as aminophylline), calculated on the basis of ideal body weight and administered over 30 minutes, on average, will produce a maximum post-distribution serum concentration of 10 mcg/mL with a range of 6-16 mcg/mL. When a loading dose becomes necessary in the patient who has already received theophylline, estimation of the serum concentration based upon the history is unreliable, and an immediate serum level determination is indicated. The loading dose can then be determined as follows: D = (Desired C - Measured C) (V) where D is the loading dose, C is the serum theophylline concentration, and V is the volume of distribution. The mean volume of distribution can be assumed to be 0.5 L/kg and the desired serum concentration should be conservative (e.g., 10 mcg/mL) to allow for the variability in the volume of distribution. A loading dose should not be given before obtaining a serum theophylline concentration if the patient has received any theophylline in the previous 24 hours. A serum concentration obtained 30 minutes after an intravenous loading dose, when distribution is complete, can be used to assess the need for and size of subsequent loading doses, if clinically indicated, and for guidance of continuing therapy. Once a serum concentration of 10 to 15 mcg/mL has been achieved with the use of a loading dose(s), a constant intravenous infusion is started. The rate of administration is based upon mean pharmacokinetic parameters for the population and calculated to achieve a target serum concentration of 10 mcg/mL (see Table V ). For example, in non-smoking adults, initiation of a constant intravenous theophylline infusion of 0.4 mg/kg/hr (0.5 mg/kg/hr as aminophylline) at the completion of the loading dose, on average, will result in a steady-state concentration of 10 mcg/mL with a range of 7-26 mcg/mL. The mean and range of steady-state serum concentrations are similar when the average child (age 1 to 9 years) is given a loading dose of 4.6 mg/kg theophylline (5.7 mg/kg as aminophylline) followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 0.8 mg/kg/hr (1.0 mg/kg/hr as aminophylline). Since there is large interpatient variability in theophylline clearance, serum concentrations will rise or fall when the patient's clearance is significantly different from the mean population value used to calculate the initial infusion rate. Therefore, a second serum concentration should be obtained one expected half-life after starting the constant infusion (e.g., approximately 4 hours for children age 1 to 9 and 8 hours for nonsmoking adults; See Table I for the expected half-life in additional patient populations) to determine if the concentration is accumulating or declining from the post loading dose level. If the level is declining as a result of a higher than average clearance, an additional loading dose can be administered and/or the infusion rate increased. In contrast, if the second sample demonstrates a higher level, accumulation of the drug can be assumed, and the infusion rate should be decreased before the concentration exceeds 20 mcg/mL. An additional sample is obtained 12 to 24 hours later to determine if further adjustments are required and then at 24-hour intervals to adjust for changes, if they occur. This empiric method, based upon mean pharmacokinetic parameters, will prevent large fluctuations in serum concentration during the most critical period of the patient's course. In patients with cor pulmonale, cardiac decompensation, or liver dysfunction, or in those taking drugs that markedly reduce theophylline clearance (e.g., cimetidine), the initial theophylline infusion rate should not exceed 17 mg/hr (21 mg/hr as aminophylline) unless serum concentrations can be monitored at 24-hour intervals. In these patients, 5 days may be required before steady-state is reached. Theophylline distributes poorly into body fat, therefore, mg/kg dose should be calculated on the basis of ideal body weight.

Final Dosage Adjustment Guided by Serum Theophylline Concentration ¶ Dose reduction and/or serum theophylline concentration measurement is indicated whenever adverse effects are present, physiologic abnormalities that can reduce theophylline clearance occur (e.g., sustained fever), or a drug that interacts with theophylline is added or discontinued (see WARNINGS ). Peak Serum Concentration Dosage Adjustment <9.9 mcg/mL If symptoms are not controlled and current dosage is tolerated, increase infusion rate about 25%. Recheck serum concentration after 12 hours in children and 24 hours in adults for further dosage adjustment. 10 to 14.9 mcg/mL If symptoms are controlled and current dosage is tolerated, maintain infusion rate and recheck serum concentration at 24 hour intervals.¶ If symptoms are not controlled and current dosage is tolerated consider adding additional medication(s) to treatment regimen. 15-19.9 mcg/mL Consider 10% decrease in infusion rate to provide greater margin of safety even if current dosage is tolerated.¶ 20-24.9 mcg/mL Decrease infusion rate by 25% even if no adverse effects are present.

Recheck serum concentration after 12 hours in children and 24 hours in adults to guide further dosage adjustment. If symptomatic, stop infusion and consider whether overdose treatment is indicated (see recommendations for chronic overdosage). >30 mcg/mL Stop the infusion and treat overdose as indicated (see recommendations for chronic overdosage). If theophylline is subsequently resumed, decrease infusion rate by at least 50% and recheck serum concentration after 12 hours in children and 24 hours in adults to guide further dosage adjustment. Intravenous Admixture Incompatibility: Although there have been reports of aminophylline precipitating in acidic media, these reports do not apply to the dilute solutions found in intravenous infusions. Aminophylline injection should not be mixed in a syringe with other drugs but should be added separately to the intravenous solution. When an intravenous solution containing aminophylline is given ""piggyback"", the intravenous system already in place should be turned off while the aminophylline is infused if there is a potential problem with admixture incompatibility. Because of the alkalinity of aminophylline containing solutions, drugs known to be alkali labile should be avoided in admixtures. These include epinephrine HCl, norepinephrine bitartrate, isoproterenol HCl and penicillin G potassium. It is suggested that specialized literature be consulted before preparing admixtures with aminophylline and other drugs. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. Do not use if crystals have separated from solution.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Intravenous theophylline is indicated as an adjunct to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids for the treatment of acute exacerbations of the symptoms and reversible airflow obstruction associated with asthma and other chronic lung diseases, e.g., emphysema and chronic bronchitis.","OVERDOSAGE General: The chronicity and pattern of theophylline overdosage significantly influences clinical manifestations of toxicity, management and outcome. There are two common presentations: 1) acute overdose , i.e., infusion of an excessive loading dose or excessive maintenance infusion rate for less than 24 hours, and 2) chronic overdosage , i.e., excessive maintenance infusion rate for greater than 24 hours. The most common causes of chronic theophylline overdosage include clinician prescribing of an excessive dose or a normal dose in the presence of factors known to decrease the rate of theophylline clearance and increasing the dose in response to an exacerbation of symptoms without first measuring the serum theophylline concentration to determine whether a dose increase is safe. Several studies have described the clinical manifestations of theophylline overdose following oral administration and attempted to determine the factors that predict life-threatening toxicity. In general, patients who experience an acute overdose are less likely to experience seizures than patients who have experienced a chronic overdosage, unless the peak serum theophylline concentration is >100 mcg/mL. After a chronic overdosage, generalized seizures, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and death may occur at serum theophylline concentrations >30 mcg/mL. The severity of toxicity after chronic overdosage is more strongly correlated with the patient's age than the peak serum theophylline concentration; patients >60 years are at the greatest risk for severe toxicity and mortality after a chronic overdosage. Pre-existing or concurrent disease may also significantly increase the susceptibility of a patient to a particular toxic manifestation, e.g., patients with neurologic disorders have an increased risk of seizures and patients with cardiac disease have an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias for a given serum theophylline concentration compared to patients without the underlying disease. The frequency of various reported manifestations of oral theophylline overdose according to the mode of overdose are listed in Table IV . Other manifestations of theophylline toxicity include increases in serum calcium, creatine kinase, myoglobin and leukocyte count, decreases in serum phosphate and magnesium, acute myocardial infarction, and urinary retention in men with obstructive uropathy. Seizures associated with serum theophylline concentrations >30 mcg/mL are often resistant to anticonvulsant therapy and may result in irreversible brain injury if not rapidly controlled. Death from theophylline toxicity is most often secondary to cardiorespiratory arrest and/or hypoxic encephalopathy following prolonged generalized seizures or intractable cardiac arrhythmias causing hemodynamic compromise. Overdose Management: General Recommendations for Patients with Symptoms of Theophylline Overdose or Serum Theophylline Concentrations >30 mcg/mL While Receiving Intravenous Theophylline. Stop the theophylline infusion. While simultaneously instituting treatment, contact a regional poison center to obtain updated information and advice on individualizing the recommendations that follow. Institute supportive care, including establishment of intravenous access, maintenance of the airway, and electrocardiographic monitoring. Treatment of seizures Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with theophylline-induced seizures, treatment should be rapid and aggressive. Anticonvulsant therapy should be initiated with an intravenous benzodiazepine, e.g., diazepam, in increments of 0.1 - 0.2 mg/kg every 1 - 3 minutes until seizures are terminated. Repetitive seizures should be treated with a loading dose of phenobarbital (20 mg/kg infused over 30 - 60 minutes). Case reports of theophylline overdose in humans and animal studies suggest that phenytoin is ineffective in terminating theophylline-induced seizures. The doses of benzodiazepines and phenobarbital required to terminate theophylline-induced seizures are close to the doses that may cause severe respiratory depression or respiratory arrest; the clinician should therefore be prepared to provide assisted ventilation. Elderly patients and patients with COPD may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of anticonvulsants. Barbiturate-induced coma or administration of general anesthesia may be required to terminate repetitive seizures or status epilepticus. General anesthesia should be used with caution in patients with theophylline overdose because fluorinated volatile anesthetics may sensitize the myocardium to endogenous catecholamines released by theophylline. Enflurane appears less likely to be associated with this effect than halothane and may, therefore, be safer. Neuromuscular blocking agents alone should not be used to terminate seizures since they abolish the musculoskeletal manifestations without terminating seizure activity in the brain. Anticipate Need for Anticonvulsants In patients with theophylline overdose who are at high risk for theophylline-induced seizures, e.g., patients with acute overdoses and serum theophylline concentrations >100 mcg/mL or chronic overdosage in patients >60 years of age with serum theophylline concentrations >30 mcg/mL, the need for anticonvulsant therapy should be anticipated. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam should be drawn into a syringe and kept at the patient's bedside and medical personnel qualified to treat seizures should be immediately available. In selected patients at high risk for theophylline-induced seizures, consideration should be given to the administration of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy. Situations where prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy should be considered in high risk patients include anticipated delays in instituting methods for extracorporeal removal of theophylline (e.g., transfer of a high risk patient from one health care facility to another for extracorporeal removal) and clinical circumstances that significantly interfere with efforts to enhance theophylline clearance (e.g., a neonate where dialysis may not be technically feasible or a patient with vomiting unresponsive to antiemetics who is unable to tolerate multiple-dose oral activated charcoal). In animal studies, prophylactic administration of phenobarbital, but not phenytoin , has been shown to delay the onset of theophylline-induced generalized seizures and to increase the dose of theophylline required to induce seizures (i.e., markedly increases the LD 50 ). Although there are no controlled studies in humans, a loading dose of intravenous phenobarbital (20 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes) may delay or prevent life-threatening seizures in high risk patients while efforts to enhance theophylline clearance are continued. Phenobarbital may cause respiratory depression, particularly in elderly patients and patients with COPD. Treatment of cardiac arrhythmias Sinus tachycardia and simple ventricular premature beats are not harbingers of life-threatening arrhythmias, they do not require treatment in the absence of hemodynamic compromise, and they resolve with declining serum theophylline concentrations. Other arrhythmias, especially those associated with hemodynamic compromise, should be treated with antiarrhythmic therapy appropriate for the type of arrhythmia. Serum Theophylline Concentration Monitoring The serum theophylline concentration should be measured immediately upon presentation, 2 - 4 hours later, and then at sufficient intervals, e.g., every 4 hours, to guide treatment decisions and to assess the effectiveness of therapy. Serum theophylline concentrations may continue to increase after presentation of the patient for medical care as a result of continued absorption of theophylline from the gastrointestinal tract. Serial monitoring of serum theophylline serum concentrations should be continued until it is clear that the concentration is no longer rising and has returned to nontoxic levels. General Monitoring Procedures Electrocardiographic monitoring should be initiated on presentation and continued until the serum theophylline level has returned to a nontoxic level. Serum electrolytes and glucose should be measured on presentation and at appropriate intervals indicated by clinical circumstances. Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be promptly corrected. Monitoring and treatment should be continued until the serum concentration decreases below 20 mcg/mL. Enhance clearance of theophylline Multiple-dose oral activated charcoal (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg up to 20 g, every two hours) increases the clearance of theophylline at least twofold by adsorption of theophylline secreted into gastrointestinal fluids. Charcoal must be retained in, and pass through, the gastrointestinal tract to be effective; emesis should therefore be controlled by administration of appropriate antiemetics. Alternatively, the charcoal can be administered continuously through a nasogastric tube in conjunction with appropriate antiemetics. A single dose of sorbitol may be administered with the activated charcoal to promote stooling to facilitate clearance of the adsorbed theophylline from the gastrointestinal tract. Sorbitol alone does not enhance clearance of theophylline and should be dosed with caution to prevent excessive stooling which can result in severe fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Commercially available fixed combinations of liquid charcoal and sorbitol should be avoided in young children and after the first dose in adolescents and adults since they do not allow for individualization of charcoal and sorbitol dosing. In patients with intractable vomiting, extracorporeal methods of theophylline removal should be instituted (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Specific Recommendations: Acute Overdose (e.g., excessive loading dose or excessive infusion rate <24 hours) Serum Concentration >20 <30 mcg/mL Stop the theophylline infusion. Monitor the patient and obtain a serum theophylline concentration in 2 - 4 hours to insure that the concentration is decreasing. Serum Concentration >30 <100 mcg/mL Stop the theophylline infusion. Administer multiple dose oral activated charcoal and measures to control emesis. Monitor the patient and obtain serial theophylline concentrations every 2 - 4 hours to gauge the effectiveness of therapy and to guide further treatment decisions. Institute extracorporeal removal if emesis, seizures, or cardiac arrhythmias cannot be adequately controlled (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Serum Concentration >100 mcg/mL Stop the theophylline infusion. Consider prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy. Administer multiple-dose oral activated charcoal and measures to control emesis. Consider extracorporeal removal, even if the patient has not experienced a seizure (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Monitor the patient and obtain serial theophylline concentrations every 2 - 4 hours to gauge the effectiveness of therapy and to guide further treatment decisions. Chronic Overdosage (e.g., excessive infusion rate for greater than 24 hours) Serum Concentration >20 <30 mcg/mL (with manifestations of theophylline toxicity) Stop the theophylline infusion. Monitor the patient and obtain a serum theophylline concentration in 2 - 4 hours to insure that the concentration is decreasing. Serum Concentration >30 mcg/mL in patients <60 years of age Stop the theophylline infusion. Administer multiple-dose oral activated charcoal and measures to control emesis. Monitor the patient and obtain serial theophylline concentrations every 2 - 4 hours to gauge the effectiveness of therapy and to guide further treatment decisions. Institute extracorporeal removal if emesis, seizures, or cardiac arrhythmias cannot be adequately controlled (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Serum Concentration >30 mcg/mL in patients ≥60 years of age Stop the theophylline infusion. Consider prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy. Administer multiple-dose oral activated charcoal and measures to control emesis. Consider extracorporeal removal even if the patient has not experienced a seizure (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Monitor the patient and obtain serial theophylline concentrations every 2 - 4 hours to gauge the effectiveness of therapy and to guide further treatment decisions. Extracorporeal Removal: Increasing the rate of theophylline clearance by extracorporeal methods may rapidly decrease serum concentrations, but the risks of the procedure must be weighed against the potential benefit. Charcoal hemoperfusion is the most effective method of extracorporeal removal, increasing theophylline clearance up to six fold, but serious complications, including hypotension, hypocalcemia, platelet consumption and bleeding diatheses may occur. Hemodialysis is about as efficient as multiple-dose oral activated charcoal and has a lower risk of serious complications than charcoal hemoperfusion. Hemodialysis should be considered as an alternative when charcoal hemoperfusion is not feasible and multiple-dose oral charcoal is ineffective because of intractable emesis. Serum theophylline concentrations may rebound 5 - 10 mcg/mL after discontinuation of charcoal hemoperfusion or hemodialysis due to redistribution of theophylline from the tissue compartment. Peritoneal dialysis is ineffective for theophylline removal; exchange transfusions in neonates have been minimally effective.","Medical Purchasing Solutions, LLC",AMINOPHYLLINE
AMINOPHYLLINE,N/A,N/A,Malaise,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Considerations: The steady-state serum theophylline concentration is a function of the infusion rate and the rate of theophylline clearance in the individual patient. Because of marked individual differences in the rate of theophylline clearance, the dose required to achieve a serum theophylline concentration in the 10-20 mcg/mL range varies fourfold among otherwise similar patients in the absence of factors known to alter theophylline clearance. For a given population there is no single theophylline dose that will provide both safe and effective serum concentrations for all patients. Administration of the median theophylline dose required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration in a given population may result in either sub-therapeutic or potentially toxic serum theophylline concentrations in individual patients. The dose of theophylline must be individualized on the basis of serum theophylline concentration measurements in order to achieve a dose that will provide maximum potential benefit with minimal risk of adverse effects. When theophylline is used as an acute bronchodilator, the goal of obtaining a therapeutic serum concentration is best accomplished with an intravenous loading dose. Because of rapid distribution into body fluids, the serum concentration (C) obtained from an initial loading dose (LD) is related primarily to the volume of distribution (V), the apparent space into which the drug diffuses: C = LD/V If a mean volume of distribution of about 0.5 L/kg is assumed (actual range is 0.3 to 0.7 L/kg), each mg/kg (ideal body weight) of theophylline administered as a loading dose over 30 minutes results in an average 2 mcg/mL increase in serum theophylline concentration. Therefore, in a patient who has received no theophylline in the previous 24 hours, a loading dose of intravenous theophylline of 4.6 mg/kg (5.7 mg/kg as aminophylline), calculated on the basis of ideal body weight and administered over 30 minutes, on average, will produce a maximum post-distribution serum concentration of 10 mcg/mL with a range of 6-16 mcg/mL. When a loading dose becomes necessary in the patient who has already received theophylline, estimation of the serum concentration based upon the history is unreliable, and an immediate serum level determination is indicated. The loading dose can then be determined as follows: D = (Desired C - Measured C) (V) where D is the loading dose, C is the serum theophylline concentration, and V is the volume of distribution. The mean volume of distribution can be assumed to be 0.5 L/kg and the desired serum concentration should be conservative (e.g., 10 mcg/mL) to allow for the variability in the volume of distribution. A loading dose should not be given before obtaining a serum theophylline concentration if the patient has received any theophylline in the previous 24 hours. A serum concentration obtained 30 minutes after an intravenous loading dose, when distribution is complete, can be used to assess the need for and size of subsequent loading doses, if clinically indicated, and for guidance of continuing therapy. Once a serum concentration of 10 to 15 mcg/mL has been achieved with the use of a loading dose(s), a constant intravenous infusion is started. The rate of administration is based upon mean pharmacokinetic parameters for the population and calculated to achieve a target serum concentration of 10 mcg/mL (see Table V ). For example, in non-smoking adults, initiation of a constant intravenous theophylline infusion of 0.4 mg/kg/hr (0.5 mg/kg/hr as aminophylline) at the completion of the loading dose, on average, will result in a steady-state concentration of 10 mcg/mL with a range of 7-26 mcg/mL. The mean and range of steady-state serum concentrations are similar when the average child (age 1 to 9 years) is given a loading dose of 4.6 mg/kg theophylline (5.7 mg/kg as aminophylline) followed by a constant intravenous infusion of 0.8 mg/kg/hr (1.0 mg/kg/hr as aminophylline). Since there is large interpatient variability in theophylline clearance, serum concentrations will rise or fall when the patient's clearance is significantly different from the mean population value used to calculate the initial infusion rate. Therefore, a second serum concentration should be obtained one expected half-life after starting the constant infusion (e.g., approximately 4 hours for children age 1 to 9 and 8 hours for nonsmoking adults; See Table I for the expected half-life in additional patient populations) to determine if the concentration is accumulating or declining from the post loading dose level. If the level is declining as a result of a higher than average clearance, an additional loading dose can be administered and/or the infusion rate increased. In contrast, if the second sample demonstrates a higher level, accumulation of the drug can be assumed, and the infusion rate should be decreased before the concentration exceeds 20 mcg/mL. An additional sample is obtained 12 to 24 hours later to determine if further adjustments are required and then at 24-hour intervals to adjust for changes, if they occur. This empiric method, based upon mean pharmacokinetic parameters, will prevent large fluctuations in serum concentration during the most critical period of the patient's course. In patients with cor pulmonale, cardiac decompensation, or liver dysfunction, or in those taking drugs that markedly reduce theophylline clearance (e.g., cimetidine), the initial theophylline infusion rate should not exceed 17 mg/hr (21 mg/hr as aminophylline) unless serum concentrations can be monitored at 24-hour intervals. In these patients, 5 days may be required before steady-state is reached. Theophylline distributes poorly into body fat, therefore, mg/kg dose should be calculated on the basis of ideal body weight. Table V contains initial theophylline infusion rates following an appropriate loading dose recommended for patients in various age groups and clinical circumstances. Table VI contains recommendations for final theophylline dosage adjustment based upon serum theophylline concentrations. Application of these general dosing recommendations to individual patients must take into account the unique clinical characteristics of each patient. In general, these recommendations should serve as the upper limit for dosage adjustments in order to decrease the risk of potentially serious adverse events associated with unexpected large increases in serum theophylline concentration.

A single dose of sorbitol may be administered with the activated charcoal to promote stooling to facilitate clearance of the adsorbed theophylline from the gastrointestinal tract. Sorbitol alone does not enhance clearance of theophylline and should be dosed with caution to prevent excessive stooling which can result in severe fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Commercially available fixed combinations of liquid charcoal and sorbitol should be avoided in young children and after the first dose in adolescents and adults since they do not allow for individualization of charcoal and sorbitol dosing. In patients with intractable vomiting, extracorporeal methods of theophylline removal should be instituted (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Specific Recommendations: Acute Overdose (e.g., excessive loading dose or excessive infusion rate <24 hours) Serum Concentration >20 <30 mcg/mL Stop the theophylline infusion. Monitor the patient and obtain a serum theophylline concentration in 2 - 4 hours to insure that the concentration is decreasing. Serum Concentration >30 <100 mcg/mL Stop the theophylline infusion. Administer multiple dose oral activated charcoal and measures to control emesis. Monitor the patient and obtain serial theophylline concentrations every 2 - 4 hours to gauge the effectiveness of therapy and to guide further treatment decisions. Institute extracorporeal removal if emesis, seizures, or cardiac arrhythmias cannot be adequately controlled (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Serum Concentration >100 mcg/mL Stop the theophylline infusion. Consider prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy. Administer multiple-dose oral activated charcoal and measures to control emesis. Consider extracorporeal removal, even if the patient has not experienced a seizure (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Monitor the patient and obtain serial theophylline concentrations every 2 - 4 hours to gauge the effectiveness of therapy and to guide further treatment decisions. Chronic Overdosage (e.g., excessive infusion rate for greater than 24 hours) Serum Concentration >20 <30 mcg/mL (with manifestations of theophylline toxicity) Stop the theophylline infusion. Monitor the patient and obtain a serum theophylline concentration in 2 - 4 hours to insure that the concentration is decreasing. Serum Concentration >30 mcg/mL in patients <60 years of age Stop the theophylline infusion. Administer multiple-dose oral activated charcoal and measures to control emesis. Monitor the patient and obtain serial theophylline concentrations every 2 - 4 hours to gauge the effectiveness of therapy and to guide further treatment decisions. Institute extracorporeal removal if emesis, seizures, or cardiac arrhythmias cannot be adequately controlled (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Serum Concentration >30 mcg/mL in patients ≥60 years of age Stop the theophylline infusion. Consider prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy. Administer multiple-dose oral activated charcoal and measures to control emesis. Consider extracorporeal removal even if the patient has not experienced a seizure (see OVERDOSAGE , Extracorporeal Removal ). Monitor the patient and obtain serial theophylline concentrations every 2 - 4 hours to gauge the effectiveness of therapy and to guide further treatment decisions. Extracorporeal Removal: Increasing the rate of theophylline clearance by extracorporeal methods may rapidly decrease serum concentrations, but the risks of the procedure must be weighed against the potential benefit. Charcoal hemoperfusion is the most effective method of extracorporeal removal, increasing theophylline clearance up to six fold, but serious complications, including hypotension, hypocalcemia, platelet consumption and bleeding diatheses may occur. Hemodialysis is about as efficient as multiple-dose oral activated charcoal and has a lower risk of serious complications than charcoal hemoperfusion. Hemodialysis should be considered as an alternative when charcoal hemoperfusion is not feasible and multiple-dose oral charcoal is ineffective because of intractable emesis. Serum theophylline concentrations may rebound 5 - 10 mcg/mL after discontinuation of charcoal hemoperfusion or hemodialysis due to redistribution of theophylline from the tissue compartment. Peritoneal dialysis is ineffective for theophylline removal; exchange transfusions in neonates have been minimally effective.","Medical Purchasing Solutions, LLC",AMINOPHYLLINE
DIGOXIN,N/A,N/A,Malaise,"2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Digoxin dose is based on patient-specific factors (age, lean body weight, renal function, etc.). See full prescribing information. Monitor for toxicity and therapeutic effect. 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information In selecting a digoxin dosing regimen, it is important to consider factors that affect digoxin blood levels (e.g., body weight, age, renal function, concomitant drugs) since toxic levels of digoxin are only slightly higher than therapeutic levels. Dosing can be either initiated with a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing if rapid titration is desired or initiated with maintenance dosing without a loading dose. Consider interruption or reduction in digoxin dose prior to electrical cardioversion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Use digoxin solution to obtain the appropriate dose in infants, young pediatric patients, or patients with very low body weight. 2.2 Loading Dosing Regimen in Adults and Pediatric Patients For adults and pediatric patients if a loading dosage is to be given, administer half the total loading dose initially, then ¼ the loading dose every 6-8 hours twice, with careful assessment of clinical response and toxicity before each dose. The recommended loading dose is displayed in Table 1. Table 1. Recommended Digoxin Oral Loading Dose Age Total Oral Loading Dose (mcg/kg) Administer half the total loading dose initially, then ¼ the loading dose every 6 to 8 hours twice 5 to 10 years 20-45 Adults and pediatric patients over 10 years 10-15 mcg = microgram 2.3 Maintenance Dosing in Adults and Pediatric Patients Over 10 Years Old The maintenance dose is based on lean body weight, renal function, age, and concomitant products [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The recommended starting maintenance dose in adults and pediatric patients over 10 years old with normal renal function is given in Table 2. Doses may be increased every 2 weeks according to clinical response, serum drug levels, and toxicity. Table 2. Recommended Starting Digoxin Maintenance Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients Over 10 Years Old Age Total Oral Maintenance Dose, mcg/kg/day (given once daily) Adults and pediatric patients over 10 years 3.4-5.1 mcg = microgram Table 3 provides the recommended (once daily) maintenance dose for adults and pediatric patients over 10 years old (to be given once daily) according to lean body weight and renal function. The doses are based on studies in adult patients with heart failure. Alternatively, the maintenance dose may be estimated by the following formula (peak body stores lost each day through elimination): Total Maintenance Dose = Loading Dose (i.e., Peak Body Stores) x % Daily Loss/100 (% Daily Loss = 14 + Creatinine clearance/5) Reduce the dose of digoxin in patients whose lean weight is an abnormally small fraction of their total body mass because of obesity or edema.

Monitor digoxin levels in patients receiving these initial doses and increase dose if needed. c The modified Schwartz equation may be used to estimate creatinine clearance. See footnote b under Table 3. d If no loading dose administered. 2.5 Monitoring to Assess Safety, Efficacy, and Therapeutic Blood Levels Monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity and clinical response. Adjust dose based on toxicity, efficacy, and blood levels. Serum digoxin levels less than 0.5 ng/mL have been associated with diminished efficacy, while levels above 2 ng/mL have been associated with increased toxicity without increased benefit. Interpret the serum digoxin concentration in the overall clinical context, and do not use an isolated measurement of serum digoxin concentration as the basis for increasing or decreasing the digoxin dose. Serum digoxin concentrations may be falsely elevated by endogenous digoxin-like substances [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . If the assay is sensitive to these substances, consider obtaining a baseline digoxin level before starting digoxin and correct post-treatment values by the reported baseline level. Obtain serum digoxin concentrations just before the next scheduled digoxin dose or at least 6 hours after the last dose. The digoxin concentration is likely to be 10-25% lower when sampled right before the next dose (24 hours after dosing) compared to sampling 8 hours after dosing (using once-daily dosing). However, there will be only minor differences in digoxin concentrations using twice daily dosing whether sampling is done at 8 or 12 hours after a dose. 2.6 Switching from Intravenous Digoxin to Oral Digoxin When switching from intravenous to oral digoxin formulations, make allowances for differences in bioavailability when calculating maintenance dosages (see Table 6).

( 1.3 ) 1.1 Heart Failure in Adults Digoxin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure in adults. Digoxin increases left ventricular ejection fraction and improves heart failure symptoms as evidenced by improved exercise capacity and decreased heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care, while having no effect on mortality. Where possible, digoxin should be used in combination with a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. 1.2 Heart Failure in Pediatric Patients Digoxin increases myocardial contractility in pediatric patients with heart failure. 1.3 Atrial Fibrillation in Adults Digoxin is indicated for the control of ventricular response rate in adult patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.","10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms in Adults and Children The signs and symptoms of toxicity are generally similar to those described in the Adverse Reactions (6.1) but may be more frequent and can be more severe. Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity become more frequent with levels above 2 ng/mL. However, in deciding whether a patient’s symptoms are due to digoxin, the clinical state together with serum electrolyte levels and thyroid function are important factors [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Adults: The most common signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity are nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue that occur in 30-70% of patients who are overdosed. Extremely high serum concentrations produce hyperkalemia especially in patients with impaired renal function. Almost every type of cardiac arrhythmia has been associated with digoxin overdose and multiple rhythm disturbances in the same patient are common. Peak cardiac effects occur 3-6 hours following ingestion and may persist for 24 hours or longer. Arrhythmias that are considered more characteristic of digoxin toxicity are new-onset Mobitz type 1 A-V block, accelerated junctional rhythms, non-paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with A-V block, and bi-directional ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac arrest from asystole or ventricular fibrillation is usually fatal. Digoxin toxicity is related to serum concentration. As digoxin serum levels increase above 1.2 ng/mL, there is a potential for increase in adverse reactions. Furthermore, lower potassium levels increases the risk for adverse reactions. In adults with heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 10-15 mg results in death of half of patients. A dose above 25 mg ingested by an adult without heart disease appeared to be uniformly fatal if no Digoxin Immune Fab (DIGIBIND®, DIGIFAB®) was administered. Among the extra-cardiac manifestations, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia) are very common (up to 80% incidence) and precede cardiac manifestations in approximately half of the patients in most literature reports. Neurologic manifestations (e.g., dizziness, various CNS disturbances), fatigue, and malaise are very common. Visual manifestations may also occur with aberration in color vision (predominance of yellow green) the most frequent. Neurological and visual symptoms may persist after other signs of toxicity have resolved. In chronic toxicity, non-specific extra-cardiac symptoms, such as malaise and weakness, may predominate. Children: In pediatric patients, signs and symptoms of toxicity can occur during or shortly after the dose of digoxin. Frequent non-cardiac effects are similar to those observed in adults although nausea and vomiting are not seen frequently in infants and small pediatric patients. Other reported manifestations of overdose are weight loss in older age groups, failure to thrive in infants, abdominal pain caused by mesenteric artery ischemia, drowsiness, and behavioral disturbances including psychotic episodes. Arrhythmias and combinations of arrhythmias that occur in adult patients can also occur in pediatric patients although sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and rapid atrial fibrillation are seen less frequently in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are more likely to develop A-V conduction disturbances, or sinus bradycardia. Any arrhythmia in a child treated with digoxin should be considered related to digoxin until otherwise ruled out. In pediatric patients aged 1-3 years without heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 6-10 mg would result in death of half of the patients. In the same population, a dose above 10 mg resulted in death if no Digoxin Immune Fab were administered. 10.2 Treatment Chronic Overdose If there is suspicion of toxicity, discontinue digoxin and place the patient on a cardiac monitor. Correct factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid dysfunction, and concomitant medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Correct hypokalemia by administering potassium so that serum potassium is maintained between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L. Potassium is usually administered orally, but when correction of the arrhythmia is urgent and serum potassium concentration is low, potassium may be administered by the intravenous route. Monitor electrocardiogram for any evidence of potassium toxicity (e.g., peaking of T waves) and to observe the effect on the arrhythmia. Avoid potassium salts in patients with bradycardia or heart block. Symptomatic arrhythmias may be treated with Digoxin Immune Fab. Acute Overdose Patients who have intentionally or accidentally ingested massive doses of digoxin should receive activated charcoal orally or by nasogastric tube regardless of the time since ingestion since digoxin recirculates to the intestine by enterohepatic circulation. In addition to cardiac monitoring, temporarily discontinue digoxin until the adverse reaction resolves. Correct factors that may be contributing to the adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . In particular, correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Digoxin is not effectively removed from the body by dialysis because of its large extravascular volume of distribution. Life threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, high degree A-V block, bradyarrhythmia, sinus arrest) or hyperkalemia requires administration of Digoxin Immune Fab. Digoxin Immune Fab has been shown to be 80-90% effective in reversing signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Bradycardia and heart block caused by digoxin are parasympathetically mediated and respond to atropine. A temporary cardiac pacemaker may also be used. Ventricular arrhythmias may respond to lidocaine or phenytoin. When a large amount of digoxin has been ingested, especially in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalemia may be present due to release of potassium from skeletal muscle. In this case, treatment with Digoxin Immune Fab is indicated; an initial treatment with glucose and insulin may be needed if the hyperkalemia is life- threatening. Once the adverse reaction has resolved, therapy with digoxin may be reinstituted following a careful reassessment of dose.",Bryant Ranch Prepack,DIGOXIN

As digoxin serum levels increase above 1.2 ng/mL, there is a potential for increase in adverse reactions. Furthermore, lower potassium levels increases the risk for adverse reactions. In adults with heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 10-15 mg results in death of half of patients. A dose above 25 mg ingested by an adult without heart disease appeared to be uniformly fatal if no Digoxin Immune Fab (DIGIBIND®, DIGIFAB®) was administered. Among the extra-cardiac manifestations, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, anorexia) are very common (up to 80% incidence) and precede cardiac manifestations in approximately half of the patients in most literature reports. Neurologic manifestations (e.g., dizziness, various CNS disturbances), fatigue, and malaise are very common. Visual manifestations may also occur with aberration in color vision (predominance of yellow green) the most frequent. Neurological and visual symptoms may persist after other signs of toxicity have resolved. In chronic toxicity, non-specific extra-cardiac symptoms, such as malaise and weakness, may predominate. Children: In pediatric patients, signs and symptoms of toxicity can occur during or shortly after the dose of digoxin. Frequent non-cardiac effects are similar to those observed in adults although nausea and vomiting are not seen frequently in infants and small pediatric patients. Other reported manifestations of overdose are weight loss in older age groups, failure to thrive in infants, abdominal pain caused by mesenteric artery ischemia, drowsiness, and behavioral disturbances including psychotic episodes. Arrhythmias and combinations of arrhythmias that occur in adult patients can also occur in pediatric patients although sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and rapid atrial fibrillation are seen less frequently in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients are more likely to develop A-V conduction disturbances, or sinus bradycardia. Any arrhythmia in a child treated with digoxin should be considered related to digoxin until otherwise ruled out. In pediatric patients aged 1-3 years without heart disease, clinical observations suggest that an overdose of digoxin of 6-10 mg would result in death of half of the patients. In the same population, a dose above 10 mg resulted in death if no Digoxin Immune Fab were administered. 10.2 Treatment Chronic Overdose If there is suspicion of toxicity, discontinue digoxin and place the patient on a cardiac monitor. Correct factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid dysfunction, and concomitant medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Correct hypokalemia by administering potassium so that serum potassium is maintained between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L. Potassium is usually administered orally, but when correction of the arrhythmia is urgent and serum potassium concentration is low, potassium may be administered by the intravenous route. Monitor electrocardiogram for any evidence of potassium toxicity (e.g., peaking of T waves) and to observe the effect on the arrhythmia. Avoid potassium salts in patients with bradycardia or heart block. Symptomatic arrhythmias may be treated with Digoxin Immune Fab. Acute Overdose Patients who have intentionally or accidentally ingested massive doses of digoxin should receive activated charcoal orally or by nasogastric tube regardless of the time since ingestion since digoxin recirculates to the intestine by enterohepatic circulation. In addition to cardiac monitoring, temporarily discontinue digoxin until the adverse reaction resolves. Correct factors that may be contributing to the adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . In particular, correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Digoxin is not effectively removed from the body by dialysis because of its large extravascular volume of distribution. Life threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, high degree A-V block, bradyarrhythmia, sinus arrest) or hyperkalemia requires administration of Digoxin Immune Fab. Digoxin Immune Fab has been shown to be 80-90% effective in reversing signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Bradycardia and heart block caused by digoxin are parasympathetically mediated and respond to atropine. A temporary cardiac pacemaker may also be used. Ventricular arrhythmias may respond to lidocaine or phenytoin. When a large amount of digoxin has been ingested, especially in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalemia may be present due to release of potassium from skeletal muscle. In this case, treatment with Digoxin Immune Fab is indicated; an initial treatment with glucose and insulin may be needed if the hyperkalemia is life- threatening. Once the adverse reaction has resolved, therapy with digoxin may be reinstituted following a careful reassessment of dose.",Bryant Ranch Prepack,DIGOXIN

VANCOMYCIN,54,801,Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Infusion-related events are related to both the concentration and the rate of administration of vancomycin. Concentrations of no more than 5 mg/mL and rates of no more than 10 mg/min, are recommended in adults (see also age-specific recommendations). In selected patients in need of fluid restriction, a concentration up to 10 mg/mL may be used; use of such higher concentrations may increase the risk of infusion-related events. An infusion rate of 10 mg/min or less is associated with fewer infusion-related events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Infusion-related events may occur, however, at any rate or concentration. Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults The usual daily intravenous dose is 2 g divided either as 500 mg every 6 hours or 1 g every 12 hours. Each dose should be administered at no more than 10 mg/min or over a period of at least 60 minutes, whichever is longer. Other patient factors, such as age or obesity, may call for modification of the usual intravenous daily dose. Pediatric patients The usual intravenous dosage of vancomycin is 10 mg/kg per dose given every 6 hours. Each dose should be administered over a period of at least 60 minutes. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be warranted in these patients. Neonates In pediatric patients up to the age of 1 month, the total daily intravenous dosage may be lower. In neonates, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg is suggested, followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for neonates in the 1st week of life and every 8 hours thereafter up to the age of 1 month. Each dose should be administered over 60 minutes. In premature infants, vancomycin clearance decreases as postconceptional age decreases. Therefore, longer dosing intervals may be necessary in premature infants. Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin is recommended in these patients. Patients with Impaired Renal Function and Elderly Patients Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with impaired renal function. In premature infants and the elderly, greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function. Measurement of vancomycin serum concentrations can be helpful in optimizing therapy, especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function. Vancomycin serum concentrations can be determined by use of microbiologic assay, radioimmunoassay, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, fluorescence immunoassay, or high-pressure liquid chromatography. If creatinine clearance can be measured or estimated accurately, the dosage for most patients with renal impairment can be calculated using the following table. The dosage of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection per day in mg is about 15 times the glomerular filtration rate in mL/min (see following table). DOSAGE TABLE FOR VANCOMYCIN IN PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION (Adapted from Moellering et al. 1 ) Creatinine Clearance mL/min Vancomycin Dose mg/24 h 100 1,545 90 1,390 80 1,235 70 1,080 60 925 50 770 40 620 30 465 20 310 10 155 The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg/kg, even in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. The table is not valid for functionally anephric patients. For such patients, an initial dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentrations. The dose required to maintain stable concentrations is 1.9 mg/kg/24 hr. In patients with marked renal impairment, it may be more convenient to give maintenance doses of 250 to 1,000 mg once every several days rather than administering the drug on a daily basis. In anuria, a dose of 1,000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended. When only serum creatinine is known, the following formula (based on sex, weight and age of the patient) may be used to calculate creatinine clearance. Calculated creatinine clearances (mL/min) are only estimates. The creatinine clearance should be measured promptly. Men: [Weight (kg) x (140 – age in years)] 72 x serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL) Women: 0.85 x above value The serum creatinine must represent a steady state of renal function. Otherwise, the estimated value for creatinine clearance is not valid. Such a calculated clearance is an overestimate of actual clearance in patients with conditions: (1) characterized by decreasing renal function, such as shock, severe heart failure, or oliguria; (2) in which a normal relationship between muscle mass and total body weight is not present, such as in obese patients or those with liver disease, edema, or ascites; and (3) accompanied by debilitation, malnutrition, or inactivity. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administration by the intrathecal (intralumbar or intraventricular) routes have not been established. Intermittent infusion is the recommended method of administration. Compatibility with Other Drugs and IV Fluids The following diluents are physically and chemically compatible (with 4 g/L vancomycin hydrochloride): 5% Dextrose Injection, USP 5% Dextrose Injection and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP 5% Dextrose and Lactated Ringer’s Injection Normosol ® -M and 5% Dextrose 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Isolyte ® E Good professional practice suggests that compounded admixtures should be administered as soon after preparation as is feasible. Vancomycin solution has a low pH and may cause physical instability of other compounds. Preparation and Stability At the time of use, reconstitute the vials of Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP with Sterile Water for Injection to a concentration of 50 mg of vancomycin/mL (see following table for volume of diluent). Concentration/Vial Volume of Diluent 500 mg 10 mL 1 gram 20 mL After reconstitution, the vials may be stored in a refrigerator for 14 days without significant loss of potency. Reconstituted solutions of vancomycin (500 mg/10 mL) must be further diluted in at least 100 mL of a suitable infusion solution. For doses of 1 gram (20 mL), at least 200 mL of solution must be used. The desired dose diluted in this manner should be administered by intermittent IV infusion over a period of at least 60 minutes. Compatibility with Intravenous Fluids Solutions that are diluted with 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection may be stored in a refrigerator for 14 days without significant loss of potency. Solutions that are diluted with the following infusion fluids may be stored in a refrigerator for 96 hours: 5% Dextrose Injection and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP Lactated Ringer’s Injection USP Lactated Ringer’s and 5% Dextrose Injection USP Normosol ® -M and 5% Dextrose Isolyte ® E Acetated Ringer’s Injection Vancomycin solution has a low pH and may cause chemical or physical instability when it is mixed with other compounds. Mixtures of solutions of vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics have been shown to be physically incompatible. The likelihood of precipitation increases with higher concentrations of vancomycin. It is recommended to adequately flush the intravenous lines between the administration of these antibiotics. It is also recommended to dilute solutions of vancomycin to 5 mg/mL or less. Although intravitreal injection is not an approved route of administration for vancomycin, precipitation has been reported after intravitreal injection of vancomycin and ceftazidime for endophthalmitis using different syringes and needles. The precipitates dissolved gradually, with complete clearing of the vitreous cavity over two months and with improvement of visual acuity. Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. For Oral Administration Oral vancomycin is used in treating antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis caused by C. difficile and for staphylococcal enterocolitis. Vancomycin is not effective by the oral route for other types of infections. The usual adult total daily dosage is 500 mg to 2 g given in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days. The total daily dose in children is 40 mg/kg of body weight in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days. The total daily dosage should not exceed 2 g. The appropriate dose may be diluted in 1 oz of water and given to the patients to drink. Common flavoring syrups may be added to the solution to improve the taste for oral administration. The diluted solution may be administered via a nasogastric tube.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of serious or severe infections caused by susceptible strains of methicillin-resistant (β-lactam-resistant) staphylococci. It is indicated for penicillin-allergic patients, for patients who cannot receive or who have failed to respond to other drugs, including the penicillins or cephalosporins, and for infections caused by vancomycin-susceptible organisms that are resistant to other antimicrobial drugs. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP is indicated for initial therapy when methicillin-resistant staphylococci are suspected, but after susceptibility data are available, therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP is effective in the treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis. Its effectiveness has been documented in other infections due to staphylococci, including septicemia, bone infections, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections. When staphylococcal infections are localized and purulent, antibiotics are used as adjuncts to appropriate surgical measures. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP has been reported to be effective alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside for endocarditis caused by S. viridans or S. bovis. For endocarditis caused by enterococci (e.g., E. faecalis), vancomycin has been reported to be effective only in combination with an aminoglycoside. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP has been reported to be effective for the treatment of diphtheroid endocarditis. Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP has been used successfully in combination with either rifampin, an aminoglycoside, or both in early-onset prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by S. epidermidis or diphtheroids. Specimens for bacteriologic cultures should be obtained in order to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibilities to vancomycin. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy . The parenteral form of vancomycin hydrochloride may be administered orally for treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by C. difficile and for staphylococcal enterocolitis. Parenteral administration of vancomycin hydrochloride alone is of unproven benefit for these indications. Vancomycin is not effective by the oral route for other types of infections.","OVERDOSAGE Supportive care is advised, with maintenance of glomerular filtration. Vancomycin is poorly removed by dialysis. Hemofiltration and hemoperfusion with polysulfone resin have been reported to result in increased vancomycin clearance. The median lethal intravenous dose is 319 mg/kg in rats and 400 mg/kg in mice. To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.",Gland Pharma Limited,VANCOMYCIN HYDROCHLORIDE
ALLOPURINOL,54,801,Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Gout : Prior to initiating treatment assess serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver and kidney function tests. Prophylactic treatment for gout flares is recommended. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Patients with normal kidney function: Initial dosage is 100 mg orally daily. Increase by 100 mg weekly increments until serum uric acid of 6 mg/dl or less is reached (maximum 800 mg daily). ( 2.3 ) Patients with impaired kidney function: The initial dosage is 50 mg orally daily. Follow recommendations for titration in patients with renal impairment until target serum uric acid level is reached. ( 2.6 ) See complete information in the Full Prescribing Information (FPI). Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy : The recommended dosage is: Adults: 300 mg to 800 mg orally daily. Pediatric patients: 100 mg/m 2 orally every 8 hours to 12 hours (10 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) See complete information in the FPI. ( 2.4 , 2.6 ) Recurrent Calcium Oxalate Calculi : The recommended initial dosage in patients with normal kidney function is 200 mg to 300 mg orally daily. ( 2.5 ) Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment: See FPI for dosage modifications in patients with renal impairment. ( 2.6 ) 2.1 Recommended Testing Prior to Treatment Initiation Prior to initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets in patients with gout, assess the following baseline tests: serum uric acid level, complete blood count, chemistry panel, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and eGFR). 2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of allopurinol tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with colchicine or an anti- inflammatory agent according to practice guidelines is recommended upon initiation of allopurinol tablets. While adjusting the dosage of allopurinol tablets in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, continue flare prophylaxis drugs until serum uric acid has been normalized and the patient has been free of gout flares for several months. If a gout flare occurs during allopurinol tablets treatment, allopurinol tablets need not be discontinued. Manage the gout flare concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Gout The initial recommended dosage for the management of gout is 100 mg orally daily, with weekly increments of 100 mg, until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. Initiating treatment with lower dosages of allopurinol tablets and titrating slowly, decreases the risk of gout flares and drug induced serious adverse reactions. In patients with renal impairment the initial dosage is 50 mg orally daily with lower dose increases until serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is reached. For complete dosage recommendations for patients with renal impairment see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. The minimal effective dosage is 100 mg to 200 mg daily and the maximal recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as a single equivalent dose with the 300 mg tablet. Doses in excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses. Monitor patients’ kidney function during the early stages of administration of allopurinol tablets and decrease the dosage or withdraw the drug if persistent abnormalities in kidney function occur [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. The dosage of allopurinol tablets to achieve control of gout varies with the severity of the disease. In general, gout control is achieved with 200 mg to 300 mg daily in patients with mild gout, and with 400 mg to 600 mg daily in patients with moderate to severe tophaceous gout. Gout attacks usually become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy. If a dose of allopurinol tablets is missed, there is no need to double the dose at the next scheduled time. Allopurinol tablets is generally better tolerated if taken following meals. A fluid intake sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least 2 liters and the maintenance of a neutral or preferably, slightly alkaline urine are desirable. Inform patients of the possibility of gout flares [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Instruct them to remain on allopurinol tablets if this occurs and to increase fluid intake during therapy to prevent kidney stones. Concurrent Use of Uricosuric Agents Some patients, may benefit using uricosuric agents concurrently, to reduce serum uric acid to target levels. When transferring a patient from a uricosuric agent to allopurinol tablets, reduce the dose of the uricosuric agent over a period of several weeks and increase the dose of allopurinol tablets gradually to the required dose needed to maintain target serum uric acid level. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy Initiate therapy with allopurinol tablets 24 hours to 48 hours before the start of chemotherapy known to cause tumor cell lysis. Administer fluids sufficient to yield a daily urinary output of at least 2 liters in adults (at least 100 mL/m 2 /hour in pediatric patients) with a neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine. The recommended dosage of allopurinol tablets is: Adult patients – 300 mg to 800 mg orally daily Pediatric patients - 100 mg/m 2 orally every 8 hours to 12 hours (10 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day). In patients with body surface area < 0.5 m 2 , consider using an alternative allopurinol formulation. The dosage of allopurinol tablets to maintain normal or near-normal serum uric acid varies with the severity of the disease. Monitor serum uric acid levels at least daily and administer allopurinol tablets at a dose and frequency to maintain the serum uric acid within the normal range. Discontinue allopurinol tablets when the risk of tumor lysis has abated (2 days to 3 days from start of chemotherapy). For complete dosage recommendations for patients with renal impairment, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Management of Recurrent Calcium Oxalate Calculi in Hyperuricosuric Patients The recommended dosage for the management of recurrent calcium oxalate stones in hyperuricosuric patients is 200 mg to 300 mg orally daily in divided doses or as the single equivalent. This dose may be adjusted depending upon the resultant control of the hyperuricosuria based upon subsequent 24-hour urinary urate determinations. 2.6 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment The recommended initial dosages of allopurinol tablets in adult patients with renal impairment are shown in Tables 1 and 2 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Patients with Gout The recommended initial dosages in adult patients with gout with impaired kidney function are shown in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Initiate treatment with a lower dose of allopurinol tablets and increase the dose gradually in 50 mg/day increments every 2 weeks to 4 weeks in patients with renal impairment to decrease the risk of drug induced serious adverse reactions. Use the lowest dose possible to achieve the desired effect on serum and/or urine uric acid. Monitor kidney function in gout patients with chronic kidney disease closely when initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets and decrease or withdraw the drug if increased abnormalities in kidney function appear and persist. Table 1. Recommended Initial Dosage in Adult Patients with Gout eGFR Initial Dosage > 60 mL/minute No dosage modification > 30 to 60 mL/minute 50 mg daily > 15 to 30 mL/minute 50 mg every other day 5 to 15 mL/minute 50 mg twice weekly < 5 mL/minute 50 mg once weekly The maximum dosage that should be used in patients with various levels of renal impairment is not defined at different eGFR levels. Patients with Recurrent Calcium Oxalate Calculi Data are insufficient to provide dosage recommendations for the treatment of recurrent calcium oxalate calculi in patients with renal impairment. Allopurinol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidney, and accumulation of the drug can occur in renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy The recommended dosage of allopurinol tablets for the management of hyperuricemia associated with cancer therapy in adult patients with renal impairment is shown in Table 2 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Table 2. Recommended Dosage of Allopurinol Tablets in Adult Patients for Management of Hyperuricemia Associated with Cancer Therapy with Renal Impairment eGFR Recommended Dosage > 20 mL/min to 60 mL/min No dosage modification 10 mL/min to 20 mL/min 200 mg/day < 10 mL/min 100 mg/day On dialysis 50 mg every 12 hours, or 100 mg every 24 hours Treatment with allopurinol tablets has not been studied in pediatric patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 20 mL/min) or on dialysis. There is insufficient information to establish dosing for allopurinol tablets in pediatric patients with renal impairment. In these patients, consider the risks and potential benefits before initiating treatment with allopurinol tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] .","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Allopurinol tablets are indicated for: The management of adults with signs and symptoms of primary or secondary gout (acute attacks, tophi, joint destruction, uric acid lithiasis, and/or nephropathy) The management of adult and pediatric patients with leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumor malignancies who are receiving cancer therapy which causes elevations of serum and urinary uric acid levels The management of adult patients with recurrent calcium oxalate calculi whose daily uric acid excretion exceeds 800 mg/day in male patients and 750 mg/day in female patients, despite lifestyle changes (such as reduction of dietary sodium, non-dairy animal protein, oxylate rich foods, refined sugars and increases in oral fluids and fruits and vegetables) Limitations of Use Allopurinol tablets are not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.

Intentional overdosing of Meropenem for Injection, USP is unlikely, although accidental overdosing might occur if large doses are given to patients with reduced renal function. The largest dose of meropenem administered in clinical trials has been 2 grams given intravenously every 8 hours. At this dosage, no adverse pharmacological effects or increased safety risks have been observed. Limited postmarketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse event profile described in the Adverse Reactions section and are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Consider symptomatic treatments. In individuals with normal renal function, rapid renal elimination takes place. Meropenem and its metabolite are readily dialyzable and effectively removed by hemodialysis; however, no information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat overdosage.",Xellia Pharmaceuticals USA LLC,MEROPENEM

Perioperative Prophylactic Use : To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery, recommended doses are: a. 1 gram I.V. or I.M. administered ½ hour to 1 hour prior to the start of surgery. b. For lengthy operative procedures (e.g., 2 hours or more), 500 mg to 1 gram I.V. or I.M. during surgery (administration modified depending on the duration of the operative procedure). c. 500 mg to 1 gram I.V. or I.M. every 6 to 8 hours for 24 hours postoperatively. It is important that (1) the preoperative dose be given just prior (1/2 hour to 1 hour) to the start of surgery so that adequate antibiotic levels are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial surgical incision; and (2) Cefazolin for Injection be administered, if necessary, at appropriate intervals during surgery to provide sufficient levels of the antibiotic at the anticipated moments of greatest exposure to infective organisms. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open‑heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery. Dosage Adjustment for Patients With Reduced Renal Function: Cefazolin for Injection may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments: Patients with a creatinine clearance of 55 mL/min. or greater or a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg % or less can be given full doses. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 35 to 54 mL/min. or serum creatinine of 1.6 to 3.0 mg % can also be given full doses but dosage should be restricted to at least 8 hour intervals. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 11 to 34 mL/min. or serum creatinine of 3.1 to 4.5 mg % should be given 1 / 2 the usual dose every 12 hours. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of 10 mL/min. or less or serum creatinine of 4.6 mg % or greater should be given 1 / 2 the usual dose every 18 to 24 hours. All reduced dosage recommendations apply after an initial loading dose appropriate to the severity of the infection. Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis: See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Pediatric Dosage: In pediatric patients, a total daily dosage of 25 to 50 mg per kg (approximately 10 to 20 mg per pound) of body weight, divided into 3 or 4 equal doses, is effective for most mild to moderately severe infections. Total daily dosage may be increased to 100 mg per kg (45 mg per pound) of body weight for severe infections. Since safety for use in premature infants and in neonates has not been established, the use of Cefazolin for Injection in these patients is not recommended.

Respiratory Tract Infections: Due to S. pneumoniae, Klebsiella species , H. influenzae, S. aureus (penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant), and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. Injectable benzathine penicillin is considered the drug of choice in treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever. Cefazolin for Injection, USP is effective in the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of Cefazolin for Injection, USP in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present. Urinary Tract Infections: Due to E. coli, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella species, and some strains of enterobacter and enterococci. Skin and Skin Structure Infections: Due to S. aureus (penicillin‑sensitive and penicillin-resistant), group A beta‑hemolytic streptococci, and other strains of streptococci. Biliary Tract Infections: Due to E. coli , various strains of streptococci, P. mirabilis , Klebsiella species, and S. aureus . Bone and Joint Infections: Due to S. aureus . Genital Infections: (i.e., prostatitis, epididymitis) due to E. coli , P. mirabilis , Klebsiella species, and some strains of enterococci. Septicemia: Due to S. pneumoniae , S. aureus (penicillin‑sensitive and penicillin‑resistant), P. mirabilis , E. coli , and Klebsiella species. Endocarditis: Due to S. aureus (penicillin‑sensitive and penicillin‑resistant) and group A beta‑hemolytic streptococci. Perioperative Prophylaxis: The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures which are classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., vaginal hysterectomy, and cholecystectomy in high‑risk patients such as those older than 70 years, with acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, or common duct bile stones). The perioperative use of Cefazolin for Injection may also be effective in surgical patients in whom infection at the operative site would present a serious risk (e.g., during open‑heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty). The prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection should usually be discontinued within a 24‑hour period after the surgical procedure. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of Cefazolin for Injection may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery. If there are signs of infection, specimens for cultures should be obtained for the identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapy may be instituted. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) To reduce the development of drug‑resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefazolin for Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.","WARNINGS BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFAZOLIN, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS GIVEN TO PENICILLIN‑SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS‑HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG BETA‑LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFAZOLIN FOR INJECTION OCCURS, DISCONTINUE TREATMENT WITH THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, IV FLUIDS, IV ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefazolin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of “antibiotic‑associated colitis.” After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an oral antibacterial drug clinically effective against C. difficile colitis.","WG Critical Care, LLC",CEFAZOLIN

A patient may self-inject HUMIRA or a caregiver may inject HUMIRA using either the HUMIRA Pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. HUMIRA can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the HUMIRA Pen, prefilled syringe, or single-dose institutional use vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. HUMIRA does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe. NOTE: Instruct patients sensitive to latex not to handle the needle cover of the HUMIRA 40 mg/0.8 mL Pen and 40 mg/0.8 mL, 20 mg/0.4 mL and 10 mg/0.2 mL prefilled syringe because it may contain natural rubber latex [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 ) ] . Instruct patients using the HUMIRA Pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see Instructions for Use ] . Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time. The HUMIRA single-dose institutional use vial is for administration within an institutional setting only, such as a hospital, physician’s office or clinic. Withdraw the dose using a sterile needle and syringe and administer promptly by a healthcare provider within an institutional setting. Only administer one dose per vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE HUMIRA is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker indicated for: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) ( 1.1 ): reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA.

FENTANYL,43,801,Toxicity to various agents,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Fentanyl Citrate Injection should be administered only by persons specifically trained in the use of intravenous anesthetics and management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids. Ensure that an opioid antagonist, resuscitative and intubation equipment, and oxygen are readily available ( 2.1 ). Individualize dosing based on the factors such as age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological condition, use of other drugs, type of anesthesia to be used, and the surgical procedure involved. ( 2.1 ) Initiate treatment in adults with 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 mL). ( 2.2 ) Initiate treatment in children 2 to 12 years of age, with a reduced dose as low as 2 to 3 mcg/kg. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Fentanyl Citrate Injection should be administered only by persons specifically trained in the use of intravenous anesthetics and management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids. Ensure that an opioid antagonist, resuscitative and intubation equipment, and oxygen are readily available. Individualize dosage based on factors such as age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological condition, use of other drugs, type of anesthesia to be used, and the surgical procedure involved. Monitor vital signs routinely. As with other potent opioids, the respiratory depressant effect of fentanyl may persist longer than the measured analgesic effect. The total dose of all opioid agonists administered should be considered by the practitioner before ordering opioid analgesics during recovery from anesthesia. If Fentanyl Citrate Injection is administered with a CNS depressant, become familiar with the properties of each drug, particularly each product's duration of action. In addition, when such a combination is used, fluids and other countermeasures to manage hypotension should be available [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Dosage 50 mcg = 0.05 mg = 1 mL Premedication in Adults 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 mL) may be administered intramuscularly 30 to 60 minutes prior to surgery. Adjunct to General Anesthesia See Dosage Range Charts below. Table 1: Dosage Range Chart Total Dosage (expressed as fentanyl base) Low Dose —2 mcg/kg (0.002 mg/kg) (0.04 mL/kg). For use in minor, but painful, surgical procedures. May also provide some pain relief in the immediate postoperative period. Moderate Dose —2 to 20 mcg/kg (0.002 to 0.02 mg/kg) (0.04 to 0.4 mL/kg). For use in more major surgical procedures, in addition to adequate analgesia, may abolish some of the stress response. Expect respiratory depression requiring artificial ventilation during anesthesia and careful observation of ventilation postoperatively is essential. High dose —20 to 50 mcg/kg (0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg) (0.4 to 1 mL/kg). For open heart surgery and certain more complicated neurosurgical and orthopedic procedures where surgery is more prolonged, and the stress response to surgery would be detrimental to the well-being of the patient. In conjunction with nitrous oxide/oxygen has been shown to attenuate the stress response as defined by increased levels of circulating growth hormone, catecholamine, ADH and prolactin. Expect the need of postoperative ventilation and observation due to extended post-operative respiratory depression. Maintenance Dose (expressed as fentanyl base) Low Dose —2 mcg/kg (0.002 mg/kg) (0.04 mL/kg). Additional dosages infrequently needed in these minor procedures. Moderate Dose —2 to 20 mcg/kg (0.002 to 0.02 mg/kg) (0.04 to 0.4 mL/kg). 25 to 100 mcg (0.025 to 0.1 mg) (0.5 to 2 mL) Administer intravenously or intramuscularly as needed when movement and/or changes in vital signs indicate surgical stress or lightening of analgesia. High Dose —20 to 50 mcg/kg (0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg) (0.4 to 1 mL/kg). Maintenance dosage [ranging from 25 mcg (0.025 mg) (0.5 mL) to one half the initial loading dose] as needed based on vital signs indicative of stress and lightening of analgesia. Individualize the dosage especially if the anticipated remaining operative time is short. Adjunct to Regional Anesthesia 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 mL) may be administered intramuscularly or slowly intravenously, over one to two minutes, when additional analgesia is required. Postoperatively (recovery room) 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 mL) may be administered intramuscularly for the control of pain, tachypnea and emergence delirium. The dose may be repeated in one to two hours as needed. For Induction and Maintenance in Children 2 to 12 Years of Age A reduced dose as low as 2 to 3 mcg/kg is recommended. As a General Anesthetic As a technique to attenuate the responses to surgical stress without the use of additional anesthetic agents, doses of 50 to 100 mcg/kg (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) (1 to 2 mL/kg) may be administered with oxygen and a muscle relaxant. In certain cases, doses up to 150 mcg/kg (0.15 mg/kg) (3 mL/kg) may be necessary to produce this anesthetic effect. It has been used for open heart surgery and certain other major surgical procedures in patients for whom protection of the myocardium from excess oxygen demand is particularly indicated, and for certain complicated neurological and orthopedic procedures.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fentanyl Citrate Injection is indicated for: analgesic action of short duration during the anesthetic periods, premedication, induction and maintenance, and in the immediate postoperative period (recovery room) as the need arises. use as a narcotic analgesic supplement in general or regional anesthesia. administration with a neuroleptic as an anesthetic premedication, for the induction of anesthesia and as an adjunct in the maintenance of general and regional anesthesia. use as an anesthetic agent with oxygen in selected high risk patients, such as those undergoing open heart surgery or certain complicated neurological or orthopedic procedures.

Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measured (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of fentanyl in Fentanyl Citrate Injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.","Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC",FENTANYL CITRATE

Individual patient response to cocaine varies widely. Toxic symptoms may occur idiosyncratically at low doses. Manifestations of cocaine overdose associated with illicit use of cocaine reported in literature and based on reports in FDA’s Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) database include death, cardio- respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, tachycardia, myocardial infarction, agitation, aggression, restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, panic states, hyperpyrexia, and rhabdomyolysis. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central nervous system stimulation. Other reactions include arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension, circulatory collapse, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Fatal poisoning is usually preceded by convulsions and coma. Because cocaine is significantly distributed to tissues and rapidly metabolized, dialysis and hemoperfusion are not effective.

For use in minor, but painful, surgical procedures. May also provide some pain relief in the immediate postoperative period. Moderate Dose —2 to 20 mcg/kg (0.002 to 0.02 mg/kg) (0.04 to 0.4 mL/kg). For use in more major surgical procedures, in addition to adequate analgesia, may abolish some of the stress response. Expect respiratory depression requiring artificial ventilation during anesthesia and careful observation of ventilation postoperatively is essential. High dose —20 to 50 mcg/kg (0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg) (0.4 to 1 mL/kg). For open heart surgery and certain more complicated neurosurgical and orthopedic procedures where surgery is more prolonged, and the stress response to surgery would be detrimental to the well-being of the patient. In conjunction with nitrous oxide/oxygen has been shown to attenuate the stress response as defined by increased levels of circulating growth hormone, catecholamine, ADH and prolactin. Expect the need of postoperative ventilation and observation due to extended post-operative respiratory depression. Maintenance Dose (expressed as fentanyl base) Low Dose —2 mcg/kg (0.002 mg/kg) (0.04 mL/kg). Additional dosages infrequently needed in these minor procedures. Moderate Dose —2 to 20 mcg/kg (0.002 to 0.02 mg/kg) (0.04 to 0.4 mL/kg). 25 to 100 mcg (0.025 to 0.1 mg) (0.5 to 2 mL) Administer intravenously or intramuscularly as needed when movement and/or changes in vital signs indicate surgical stress or lightening of analgesia. High Dose —20 to 50 mcg/kg (0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg) (0.4 to 1 mL/kg). Maintenance dosage [ranging from 25 mcg (0.025 mg) (0.5 mL) to one half the initial loading dose] as needed based on vital signs indicative of stress and lightening of analgesia. Individualize the dosage especially if the anticipated remaining operative time is short. Adjunct to Regional Anesthesia 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 mL) may be administered intramuscularly or slowly intravenously, over one to two minutes, when additional analgesia is required. Postoperatively (recovery room) 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 mL) may be administered intramuscularly for the control of pain, tachypnea and emergence delirium. The dose may be repeated in one to two hours as needed. For Induction and Maintenance in Children 2 to 12 Years of Age A reduced dose as low as 2 to 3 mcg/kg is recommended. As a General Anesthetic As a technique to attenuate the responses to surgical stress without the use of additional anesthetic agents, doses of 50 to 100 mcg/kg (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) (1 to 2 mL/kg) may be administered with oxygen and a muscle relaxant. In certain cases, doses up to 150 mcg/kg (0.15 mg/kg) (3 mL/kg) may be necessary to produce this anesthetic effect. It has been used for open heart surgery and certain other major surgical procedures in patients for whom protection of the myocardium from excess oxygen demand is particularly indicated, and for certain complicated neurological and orthopedic procedures.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fentanyl Citrate Injection is indicated for: analgesic action of short duration during the anesthetic periods, premedication, induction and maintenance, and in the immediate postoperative period (recovery room) as the need arises. use as a narcotic analgesic supplement in general or regional anesthesia. administration with a neuroleptic as an anesthetic premedication, for the induction of anesthesia and as an adjunct in the maintenance of general and regional anesthesia. use as an anesthetic agent with oxygen in selected high risk patients, such as those undergoing open heart surgery or certain complicated neurological or orthopedic procedures.

Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measured (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of fentanyl in Fentanyl Citrate Injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.","Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC",FENTANYL CITRATE
OXYCODONE,37,801,Toxicity to various agents,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. (2.1) Individualize dosing based on severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse and misuse. (2.1) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient’s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone hydrochloride. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose. (2.2, 5.1, 5.3, 5.6) Initiate dosing with a range of 5 to 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. (2.3) For control of chronic pain, administer oxycodone hydrochloride on a regularly scheduled basis, at the lowest dosage level to achieve adequate analgesia. (2.3) Individually titrate oxycodone hydrochloride to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. (2.4) Do not abruptly discontinue oxycodone hydrochloride in a physically dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. (2.5) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with oxycodone hydrochloride and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . 2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.6)]. Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. 2.3 Initial Dosage Although it is not possible to list every condition that is important to the selection of the initial dose of oxycodone hydrochloride, attention must be given to: 1. the daily dose, potency and characteristics of a full agonist or mixed agonist/antagonist the patient has been taking previously. 2. the reliability of the relative potency estimate to calculate the dose of oxycodone HCl needed. 3. the degree of opioid tolerance. 4. the general condition and medical status of the patient, including the patient’s weight and age. 5. the balance between pain management and adverse reactions. 6. the type and severity of the patient’s pain. 7. risk factors for abuse or addiction, including a prior history of abuse or addiction. Use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate treatment with oxycodone hydrochloride in a dosing range of 5 to 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of oxycodone hydrochloride. Patients with chronic pain should have their dosage given on an around-the-clock basis to prevent the reoccurrence of pain rather than treating the pain after it has occurred. This dose can then be adjusted to an acceptable level of analgesia taking into account side effects experienced by the patient. For control of severe chronic pain, oxycodone hydrochloride should be administered on a regularly scheduled basis, every 4 to 6 hours, at the lowest dosage level that will achieve adequate analgesia. Conversion from Other Opioids to Oxycodone Hydrochloride There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of oxycodone hydrochloride. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour oxycodone hydrochloride dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour oxycodone hydrochloride dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If a patient has been receiving opioid-containing medications prior to taking oxycodone hydrochloride, the potency of the prior opioid relative to oxycodone should be factored into the selection of the total daily dose (TDD) of oxycodone. In converting patients from other opioids to oxycodone hydrochloride close observation and adjustment of dosage based upon the patient’s response to oxycodone hydrochloride is imperative. Administration of supplemental analgesia for breakthrough or incident pain and titration of the total daily dose of oxycodone hydrochloride may be necessary, especially in patients who have disease states that are changing rapidly. Conversion from Fixed-Ratio Opioid/Acetaminophen, Opioid/Aspirin, or Opioid/Nonsteroidal Combination Drugs When converting patients from fixed ratio opioid/non-opioid drug regimens a decision should be made whether or not to continue the non-opioid analgesic. If a decision is made to discontinue the use of non-opioid analgesic, it may be necessary to titrate the dose of oxycodone hydrochloride in response to the level of analgesia and adverse effects afforded by the dosing regimen. If the non-opioid regimen is continued as a separate single entity agent, the starting dose oxycodone hydrochloride should be based upon the most recent dose of opioid as a baseline for further titration of oxycodone. Incremental increases should be gauged according to side effects to an acceptable level of analgesia. Conversion from oxycodone hydrochloride to Extended-Release Oxycodone The relative bioavailability of oxycodone hydrochloride compared to extended-release oxycodone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression. 2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate oxycodone hydrochloride to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving oxycodone hydrochloride to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the oxycodone hydrochloride dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.5 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Do not abruptly discontinue oxycodone hydrochloride in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking oxycodone hydrochloride, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of oxycodone hydrochloride the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on oxycodone hydrochloride who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] .","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Oxycodone hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] , reserve oxycodone hydrochloride tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products): • Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, • Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.

Moderate Dose —2 to 20 mcg/kg (0.002 to 0.02 mg/kg) (0.04 to 0.4 mL/kg). 25 to 100 mcg (0.025 to 0.1 mg) (0.5 to 2 mL) Administer intravenously or intramuscularly as needed when movement and/or changes in vital signs indicate surgical stress or lightening of analgesia. High Dose —20 to 50 mcg/kg (0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg) (0.4 to 1 mL/kg). Maintenance dosage [ranging from 25 mcg (0.025 mg) (0.5 mL) to one half the initial loading dose] as needed based on vital signs indicative of stress and lightening of analgesia. Individualize the dosage especially if the anticipated remaining operative time is short. Adjunct to Regional Anesthesia 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 mL) may be administered intramuscularly or slowly intravenously, over one to two minutes, when additional analgesia is required. Postoperatively (recovery room) 50 to 100 mcg (0.05 to 0.1 mg) (1 to 2 mL) may be administered intramuscularly for the control of pain, tachypnea and emergence delirium. The dose may be repeated in one to two hours as needed. For Induction and Maintenance in Children 2 to 12 Years of Age A reduced dose as low as 2 to 3 mcg/kg is recommended. As a General Anesthetic As a technique to attenuate the responses to surgical stress without the use of additional anesthetic agents, doses of 50 to 100 mcg/kg (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) (1 to 2 mL/kg) may be administered with oxygen and a muscle relaxant. In certain cases, doses up to 150 mcg/kg (0.15 mg/kg) (3 mL/kg) may be necessary to produce this anesthetic effect. It has been used for open heart surgery and certain other major surgical procedures in patients for whom protection of the myocardium from excess oxygen demand is particularly indicated, and for certain complicated neurological and orthopedic procedures.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fentanyl Citrate Injection is indicated for: analgesic action of short duration during the anesthetic periods, premedication, induction and maintenance, and in the immediate postoperative period (recovery room) as the need arises. use as a narcotic analgesic supplement in general or regional anesthesia. administration with a neuroleptic as an anesthetic premedication, for the induction of anesthesia and as an adjunct in the maintenance of general and regional anesthesia. use as an anesthetic agent with oxygen in selected high risk patients, such as those undergoing open heart surgery or certain complicated neurological or orthopedic procedures. Fentanyl Citrate Injection is indicated for: analgesic action of short duration during the anesthetic periods, premedication, induction and maintenance and in the immediate postoperative period (recovery room) as the need arises. use as an opioid analgesic supplement in general or regional anesthesia. administration with a neuroleptic as an anesthetic premedication, for the induction of anesthesia and as an adjunct in the maintenance of general and regional anesthesia. use as an anesthetic agent with oxygen in selected high risk patients, such as those undergoing open heart surgery or certain complicated neurological or orthopedic procedures.","10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with Fentanyl Citrate Injection can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measured (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of fentanyl in Fentanyl Citrate Injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.","Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC",FENTANYL CITRATE
METHAMPHETAMINE,30,801,Toxicity to various agents,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets are given orally. Methamphetamine should be administered at the lowest effective dosage, and dosage should be individually adjusted. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the resulting insomnia. Prior to treating patients with methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets, assess: • for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) (see WARNINGS ). • the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette’s syndrome (see WARNINGS ). Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity For treatment of children 6 years or older with a behavioral syndrome characterized by moderate to severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability and impulsivity: an initial dose of 5 mg methamphetamine once or twice a day is recommended. Daily dosage may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until an optimum clinical response is achieved. The usual effective dose is 20 to 25 mg daily. The total daily dose may be given in two divided doses daily.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity: Methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes other remedial measures (psychological, educational, social) for a stabilizing effect in children over 6 years of age with a behavioral syndrome characterized by the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms: moderate to severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. The diagnosis of this syndrome should not be made with finality when these symptoms are only of comparatively recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning disability, and abnormal EEG may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction may or may not be warranted.","OVERDOSAGE Clinical Effects of Overdose Overdose of CNS stimulants is characterized by the following sympathomimetic effects: • Cardiovascular effects including tachyarrhythmias, and hypertension or hypotension. Vasospasm, myocardial infarction, or aortic dissection may precipitate sudden cardiac death. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop. • CNS effects including psychomotor agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. Serotonin syndrome, seizures, cerebral vascular accidents, and coma may occur. • Life-threatening hyperthermia (temperatures greater than 104 o F) and rhabdomyolysis may develop. Overdose Management Consider the possibility of multiple drug ingestion. D-amphetamine is not dialyzable.

Dosages of Enbrel higher than those described in Table 2 have not been studied in pediatric patients. In pJIA patients, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, or analgesics may be continued during treatment with Enbrel. 2.5 Preparation Instructions for Enbrel Enbrel is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician. Patients may self-inject when deemed appropriate and if they receive medical follow-up, as necessary. Patients should not self-administer until they receive proper training in how to prepare and administer the correct dose. Administer injections subcutaneously in the thigh, abdomen or outer area of the upper arm. The Enbrel devices are not made with natural rubber latex. The Enbrel (etanercept) ""Instructions for Use"" insert for each presentation contains more detailed instructions on injection site selection and the preparation of Enbrel. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Prefilled Syringe For a more comfortable injection, leave Enbrel prefilled syringes at room temperature for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the needle cover while allowing the prefilled syringe to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. When using the Enbrel single-dose prefilled syringe, check to see if the amount of liquid in the prefilled syringe falls between the two purple fill level indicator lines on the syringe. If the syringe does not have the right amount of liquid, DO NOT USE THAT SYRINGE. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Prefilled SureClick Autoinjector Leave the autoinjector at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the needle cover while allowing the prefilled syringe to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. Preparation of Enbrel Single-dose Vial For a more comfortable injection, leave Enbrel vial(s) at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the vial cap while allowing the vial to reach room temperature. Inspect visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. When using the Enbrel single-dose vial, administer the correct dose of solution using the following recommended materials: A 1 mL Luer-Lock syringe. A withdrawal needle with Luer-Lock connection, sterile, 22-gauge, length 1 ½ inch. An injection needle with Luer-Lock connection, sterile, 27-gauge, length ½ inch. Two vials may be required to administer the total prescribed dose. Use the same syringe for each vial. The vial does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions. Preparation of Enbrel Lyophilized Powder in a Multiple-dose Vial Enbrel lyophilized powder should be reconstituted aseptically with 1 mL of the supplied Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol), giving a solution of 1 mL containing 25 mg of Enbrel. A vial adapter is supplied for use when reconstituting the lyophilized powder. However, the vial adapter should not be used if multiple doses are going to be withdrawn from the vial. If the vial will be used for multiple doses, a 25-gauge needle should be used for reconstituting and withdrawing Enbrel, and the supplied ""Mixing Date:"" sticker should be attached to the vial and the date of reconstitution entered. Reconstituted solution must be refrigerated at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C) and used within 14 days. Discard reconstituted solution after 14 days because product stability and sterility cannot be assured after 14 days. DO NOT store reconstituted Enbrel solution at room temperature. For a more comfortable injection, leave the Enbrel dose tray at room temperature for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting. If using the vial adapter, twist the vial adapter onto the diluent syringe. Then, place the vial adapter over the Enbrel vial and insert the vial adapter into the vial stopper. Push down on the plunger to inject the diluent into the Enbrel vial. If using a 25-gauge needle to reconstitute and withdraw Enbrel, the diluent should be injected very slowly into the Enbrel vial. It is normal for some foaming to occur. Keeping the diluent syringe in place, gently swirl the contents of the Enbrel vial during dissolution. To avoid excessive foaming, do not shake or vigorously agitate. Generally, dissolution of Enbrel takes less than 10 minutes. Do not use the solution if discolored or cloudy, or if particulate matter remains. Withdraw the correct dose of reconstituted solution into the syringe. Some foam or bubbles may remain in the vial. Remove the syringe from the vial adapter or remove the 25-gauge needle from the syringe. Attach a 27-gauge needle to inject Enbrel. The contents of one vial of Enbrel solution should not be mixed with, or transferred into, the contents of another vial of Enbrel. No other medications should be added to solutions containing Enbrel, and do not reconstitute Enbrel with other diluents. Do not filter reconstituted solution during preparation or administration. Preparation of Enbrel Mini ® single-dose prefilled cartridge using the AutoTouch ® reusable autoinjector Leave Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting. DO NOT remove the purple cap while allowing the cartridge to reach room temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. There may be small white particles of protein in the solution. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The solution should not be used if discolored or cloudy, or if foreign particulate matter is present. To use AutoTouch reusable autoinjector, open the door by pushing the door button and inserting Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge into AutoTouch. When inserted correctly, Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridge will slide freely and completely into the door.

Vials are intended for intravenous use only (not for subcutaneous use) and autoinjectors and prefilled syringes are intended for subcutaneous use only (not for intravenous use). 2.2 Recommended Intravenous Dosage for Adult and Pediatric Patients with SLE or Lupus Nephritis Dosage BENLYSTA for intravenous use must be reconstituted and diluted prior to administration. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. The recommended intravenous dosage is 10 mg/kg at 2‑week intervals for the first 3 doses and at 4‑week intervals thereafter. Reconstitute, dilute, and administer as an intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction. The infusion must be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences a serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Precautions Prior to Intravenous Use BENLYSTA should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Prior to intravenous dosing with BENLYSTA, consider administering premedication for prophylaxis against infusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Preparation of Intravenous Solutions BENLYSTA for intravenous use is provided as a lyophilized powder in a single‑dose vial and should be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique as follows. Use of a 21- to 25-gauge needle is recommended when piercing the vial stopper for reconstitution and dilution. Reconstitution Instructions for Intravenous Use: 1. Remove the vial of BENLYSTA from the refrigerator and allow to stand for 10 to 15 minutes for the vial to reach room temperature. 2. Reconstitute the BENLYSTA powder with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, as follows. The reconstituted solution will contain a concentration of 80 mg/mL belimumab. 3. Reconstitute the 120-mg vial with 1.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 4. Reconstitute the 400-mg vial with 4.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 5. The stream of sterile water should be directed toward the side of the vial to minimize foaming. Gently swirl the vial for 60 seconds. Allow the vial to sit at room temperature during reconstitution, gently swirling the vial for 60 seconds every 5 minutes until the powder is dissolved. Do not shake. Reconstitution is typically complete within 10 to 15 minutes after the sterile water has been added, but it may take up to 30 minutes. Protect the reconstituted solution from sunlight. 6. If a mechanical reconstitution device (swirler) is used to reconstitute BENLYSTA, it should not exceed 500 rpm and the vial swirled for no longer than 30 minutes. 7. Once reconstitution is complete, the solution should be opalescent and colorless to pale yellow, and without particles. Small air bubbles, however, are expected and acceptable. Dilution Instructions for Intravenous Use: 1. Dextrose intravenous solutions are incompatible with BENLYSTA. BENLYSTA should only be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline), 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (half-normal saline), or Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to a volume of 250 mL for intravenous infusion. To prepare the intravenous infusion solution for patients whose body weight is less than or equal to 40 kg, a 100 mL bag or bottle of normal saline, half-normal saline, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection may be used such that the resulting belimumab concentration in the infusion bag does not exceed 4 mg/mL. From a 250‑mL (or 100‑mL) infusion bag or bottle of normal saline, half-normal saline, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection, withdraw and discard a volume equal to the volume of the reconstituted solution of BENLYSTA required for the patient’s dose. Then add the required volume of the reconstituted solution of BENLYSTA into the intravenous infusion solution in the infusion bag or bottle. Gently invert the bag or bottle to mix the intravenous infusion solution. Any unused solution in the vials must be discarded. 2. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discoloration is observed. 3. The reconstituted solution of BENLYSTA, if not used immediately, should be stored protected from direct sunlight and refrigerated at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C). Solutions of BENLYSTA diluted in normal saline, half-normal saline, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection may be stored at 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C) or room temperature. The total time from reconstitution of BENLYSTA to completion of infusion should not exceed 8 hours. 4. No incompatibilities between BENLYSTA and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin bags have been observed. Administration Instructions for Intravenous Use 1. The diluted solution of BENLYSTA should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour. 2. BENLYSTA should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the coadministration of BENLYSTA with other agents. 2.3 Recommended Subcutaneous Dosage The recommended dosages of BENLYSTA, when administered subcutaneously, are provided in Table 1 . When administered subcutaneously, BENLYSTA should be administered in the patient’s abdomen or thigh. For patients less than 10 years of age, BENLYSTA must be administered by a healthcare professional or trained caregiver. Table 1. Recommended Subcutaneous Dosage of BENLYSTA a Autoinjector only . NOTE: The prefilled syringe has not been studied in children less than 18 years of age. b The 400-mg dose is recommended for adult patients initiating therapy with BENLYSTA for active lupus nephritis and requires administration of 2 autoinjectors or 2 prefilled syringes.

Lupus Nephritis : A patient with lupus nephritis may transition from intravenous therapy with BENLYSTA to subcutaneous therapy after the patient completes the first 2 intravenous doses. If transitioning, administer the first subcutaneous dose of 200 mg 1 to 2 weeks after the last intravenous dose. Administration Instructions for Subcutaneous Injection 1. It is recommended that the first subcutaneous injection of BENLYSTA should be under the supervision of a healthcare professional. The healthcare provider should provide proper training in subcutaneous technique and education about signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . A patient may self-inject or the patient caregiver may administer BENLYSTA subcutaneously after the healthcare provider determines it is appropriate. 2. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to follow the directions for administration provided in the Instructions for Use. 3. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to remove the autoinjector or prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to the subcutaneous injection. Do not warm BENLYSTA in any other way. 4. Prior to administration, instruct the patient or patient caregiver to visually inspect the window of the autoinjector or the prefilled syringe for particulate matter or discoloration. BENLYSTA should be clear to opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Do not use BENLYSTA if the product exhibits discoloration or particulate matter. Instruct the patient not to use the BENLYSTA autoinjector or prefilled syringe if dropped on a hard surface. 5. When injecting in the same body region, advise the patient or patient caregiver to use a different injection site for each injection; never give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. When a 400-mg dose is administered at the same site, it is recommended that the 2 individual 200-mg injections be administered at least 5 cm (approximately 2 inches) apart. 6. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to administer BENLYSTA, preferably on the same day each week or the same day of alternate weeks, as appropriate. 7. If a dose is missed, instruct the patient to administer a dose as soon as the patient remembers. Thereafter, the patient can resume dosing on their usual day of administration or start a new schedule from the day that the missed dose was administered.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BENLYSTA (belimumab) is indicated for the treatment of: • patients 5 years of age and older with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are receiving standard therapy, and • patients 5 years of age and older with active lupus nephritis who are receiving standard therapy.

HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE,N/A,N/A,Suicidal ideation,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION One Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablet contains 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, which is equivalent to 155 mg base. Take Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets with a meal or a glass of milk. Malaria Prophylaxis Adults: 400 mg (310 mg base) once weekly on the same day of each week starting 2 weeks prior to exposure, and continued for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. Weight-based dosing in adults and pediatric patients: 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base), not to exceed 400 mg (310 mg base), once weekly on the same day of the week starting 2 weeks prior to exposure, and continued for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria Adults: 800 mg (620 mg base) followed by 400 mg (310 mg base) at 6 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after the initial dose (total 2000 mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate or 1550 mg base). Weight based dosage in adults and pediatric patients: 13 mg/kg (10 mg/kg base), not to exceed 800 mg (620 mg base) followed by 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base), not to exceed 400 mg (310 mg base), at 6 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after the initial dose. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate film-coated tablets cannot be divided, therefore they should not be used to treat patients who weigh less than 31 kg. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. malariae infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary. Lupus Erythematosus The recommended adult dosage is 200 to 400 mg (155 to 310 mg base) daily, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses. Doses above 400 mg a day are not recommended. The incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is exceeded. Rheumatoid Arthritis The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Initial adult dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg (310 to 465 mg base) daily, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses. In a small percentage of patients, side effects may require temporary reduction of the initial dosage. Maintenance adult dosage: When a good response is obtained, the dosage may be reduced by 50 percent and continued at a maintenance level of 200 mg to 400 mg (155 to 310 mg base) daily, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses. Do not exceed 600 mg or 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) per day, whichever is lower, as the incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is exceeded. Corticosteroids and salicylates may be used in conjunction with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, and they can generally be decreased gradually in dosage or eliminated after a maintenance dose of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets has been achieved.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Malaria Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax . Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported. Limitations of Use in Malaria Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for the treatment of complicated malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not effective against chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology ). Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for the treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for malaria prophylaxis in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets do not prevent relapses of P. vivax or P.ovale because they are ot active against the hypnozoite forms of these parasites. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology ). Prior to prescribing Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria, consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Malaria website (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria). Lupus Erythematosus Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus in adults. Rheumatoid Arthritis Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults.","OVERDOSAGE The 4-aminoquinoline compounds are very rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion, and in accidental overdosage, or rarely with lower doses in hypersensitive patients, toxic symptoms may occur within 30 minutes. The symptoms of overdosage may include headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, hypokalemia, rhythm and conduction disorders including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest. Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt. Immediate gastric lavage until the stomach is completely emptied is indicated. After lavage, activated charcoal is introduced by the stomach tube within 30 minutes of ingestion of the drug may inhibit further intestinal absorption. To be effective, the dose of activated charcoal should be at least five times the estimated dose of hydroxychloroquine ingested. Consideration should be given to administering diazepam parenterally since studies suggest that it may be beneficial in reversing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity. Respiratory support and shock management should be instituted as necessary. Exchange transfusions are used to reduce the level of 4-aminoquinoline drug in the blood. A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed for at least six hours. Fluids may be forced and sufficient ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) may be administered for a few days to acidify the urine. This will promote urinary excretion in cases of both overdosage and sensitivity. However, caution must be exercised in patients with impaired renal function and/or metabolic acidosis.","Aphena Pharma Solutions - Tennessee, LLC",HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE

SINEMET,N/A,N/A,Cerebral haemorrhage,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The optimum daily dosage of SINEMET must be determined by careful titration in each patient. SINEMET tablets are available in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa (SINEMET 25-100) as well as 1:10 ratio (SINEMET 25-250 and SINEMET 10-100). Tablets of the two ratios may be given separately or combined as needed to provide the optimum dosage. Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa at approximately 70 to 100 mg a day. Patients receiving less than this amount of carbidopa are more likely to experience nausea and vomiting. Usual Initial Dosage Dosage is best initiated with one tablet of SINEMET 25-100 three times a day. This dosage schedule provides 75 mg of carbidopa per day. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day, as necessary, until a dosage of eight tablets of SINEMET 25-100 a day is reached. If SINEMET 10-100 is used, dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day. However, this will not provide an adequate amount of carbidopa for many patients. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (2 tablets q.i.d.) is reached. How to Transfer Patients from Levodopa Levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before starting SINEMET. A daily dosage of SINEMET should be chosen that will provide approximately 25% of the previous levodopa dosage. Patients who are taking less than 1500 mg of levodopa a day should be started on one tablet of SINEMET 25-100 three or four times a day. The suggested starting dosage for most patients taking more than 1500 mg of levodopa is one tablet of SINEMET 25-250 three or four times a day. Maintenance Therapy should be individualized and adjusted according to the desired therapeutic response. At least 70 to 100 mg of carbidopa per day should be provided. When a greater proportion of carbidopa is required, one tablet of SINEMET 25-100 may be substituted for each tablet of SINEMET 10-100. When more levodopa is required, SINEMET 25-250 should be substituted for SINEMET 25-100 or SINEMET 10-100. If necessary, the dosage of carbidopa and levodopa 25-250 may be increased by one-half or one tablet every day or every other day to a maximum of eight tablets a day. Experience with total daily dosages of carbidopa greater than 200 mg is limited. Because both therapeutic and adverse responses occur more rapidly with SINEMET than with levodopa alone, patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period. Specifically, involuntary movements will occur more rapidly with SINEMET than with levodopa. The occurrence of involuntary movements may require dosage reduction. Blepharospasm may be a useful early sign of excess dosage in some patients. Addition of Other Antiparkinsonian Medications Standard drugs for Parkinson's disease, other than levodopa without a decarboxylase inhibitor, may be used concomitantly while SINEMET is being administered, although dosage adjustments may be required. Interruption of Therapy Sporadic cases of hyperpyrexia and confusion have been associated with dose reductions and withdrawal of SINEMET. Patients should be observed carefully if abrupt reduction or discontinuation of SINEMET is required, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics. (See WARNINGS .) If general anesthesia is required, SINEMET may be continued as long as the patient is permitted to take fluids and medication by mouth. If therapy is interrupted temporarily, the patient should be observed for symptoms resembling NMS, and the usual daily dosage may be administered as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE SINEMET is indicated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and symptomatic parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication. Carbidopa allows patients treated for Parkinson's disease to use much lower doses of levodopa. Some patients who responded poorly to levodopa have improved on SINEMET. This is most likely due to decreased peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa caused by administration of carbidopa rather than by a primary effect of carbidopa on the nervous system. Carbidopa has not been shown to enhance the intrinsic efficacy of levodopa. Carbidopa may also reduce nausea and vomiting and permit more rapid titration of levodopa.","OVERDOSAGE Management of acute overdosage with SINEMET is the same as management of acute overdosage with levodopa. Pyridoxine is not effective in reversing the actions of SINEMET. General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered judiciously and an adequate airway maintained. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be instituted and the patient carefully observed for the development of arrhythmias; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy should be given. The possibility that the patient may have taken other drugs as well as SINEMET should be taken into consideration. To date, no experience has been reported with dialysis; hence, its value in overdosage is not known. Based on studies in which high doses of levodopa and/or carbidopa were administered, a significant proportion of rats and mice given single oral doses of levodopa of approximately 1500-2000 mg/kg are expected to die. A significant proportion of infant rats of both sexes are expected to die at a dose of 800 mg/kg. A significant proportion of rats are expected to die after treatment with similar doses of carbidopa. The addition of carbidopa in a 1:10 ratio with levodopa increases the dose at which a significant proportion of mice are expected to die to 3360 mg/kg.",Organon LLC,CARBIDOPA AND LEVODOPA

AZILECT,N/A,N/A,Cerebral haemorrhage,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Monotherapy: AZILECT 1 mg once daily ( 2.1 ) As adjunct without levodopa: AZILECT 1 mg once daily ( 2.1 ) As adjunct to levodopa: AZILECT 0.5 mg once daily. Increase dose to 1 mg daily as needed for sufficient clinical response ( 2.1 ) Patients taking ciprofloxacin or other CYP1A2 inhibitors: AZILECT 0.5 mg once daily ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) Patients with mild hepatic impairment: AZILECT 0.5 mg once daily. AZILECT should not be used in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( 2.3 , 5.5 ) 2.1 General Dosing Recommendations When AZILECT is prescribed as monotherapy or as adjunct therapy in patients not taking levodopa, patients may start AZILECT at the recommended dose of 1 mg administered orally once daily. In patients taking levodopa, with or without other PD drugs (e.g., dopamine agonist, amantadine, anticholinergics), the recommended initial dose of AZILECT is 0.5 mg once daily. If the patient tolerates the daily 0.5 mg dose, but a sufficient clinical response is not achieved, the dose may be increased to 1 mg once daily. When AZILECT is used in combination with levodopa, a reduction of the levodopa dose may be considered, based upon individual response. The recommended doses of AZILECT should not be exceeded because of risk of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 2.2 Patients Taking Ciprofloxacin or Other CYP1A2 Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ciprofloxacin or other CYP1A2 inhibitors should not exceed a dose of AZILECT 0.5 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment Patients with mild hepatic impairment should not exceed a dose of AZILECT 0.5 mg once daily. AZILECT should not be used in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE AZILECT (rasagiline tablets) is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD). AZILECT, a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor (MAOI), is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease ( 1 )","10 OVERDOSAGE In a dose escalation study in patients on chronic levodopa therapy treated with 10 mg of AZILECT there were three reports of cardiovascular side effects (including hypertension and postural hypotension) which resolved following treatment discontinuation. Although no cases of overdose have been observed with AZILECT during the clinical development program, the following description of presenting symptoms and clinical course is based upon overdose descriptions of nonselective MAO inhibitors. The signs and symptoms of nonselective MAOI overdose may not appear immediately. Delays of up to 12 hours after ingestion of drug and the appearance of signs may occur. The peak intensity of the syndrome may not be reached until for a day following the overdose. Death has been reported following overdose; therefore, immediate hospitalization, with continuous patient observation and monitoring for at least two days following the ingestion of such drugs in overdose, is strongly recommended. The severity of the clinical signs and symptoms of MAOI overdose varies and may be related to the amount of drug consumed. The central nervous and cardiovascular systems are prominently involved. Signs and symptoms of MAOI overdose may include: drowsiness, dizziness, faintness, irritability, hyperactivity, agitation, severe headache, hallucinations, trismus, opisthotonos, convulsions, and coma; rapid and irregular pulse, hypertension, hypotension and vascular collapse; precordial pain, respiratory depression and failure, hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, and cool, clammy skin. There is no specific antidote for AZILECT overdose. The following suggestions are offered based upon the assumption that AZILECT overdose may be modeled after nonselective MAO inhibitor poisoning. Treatment of overdose with nonselective MAO inhibitors is symptomatic and supportive. Respiration should be supported by appropriate measures, including management of the airway, use of supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilatory assistance, as required. Body temperature should be monitored closely. Intensive management of hyperpyrexia may be required. Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is essential. For this reason, in cases of overdose with AZILECT, dietary tyramine restriction should be observed for several weeks to reduce the risk of hypertensive tyramine reaction. A poison control center should be called for the most current treatment guidelines. A postmarketing report described a single patient who developed a nonfatal serotonin syndrome after ingesting 100 mg of AZILECT in a suicide attempt. Another patient who was treated in error with 4 mg AZILECT daily and tramadol also developed a serotonin syndrome. One patient who was treated in error with 3 mg AZILECT daily experienced alternating episodes of vascular fluctuations consisting of hypertension and orthostatic hypotension.","Teva Neuroscience, Inc.",RASAGILINE MESYLATE

LISINOPRIL,57,801,Haemoglobin decreased,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10 mg to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component. The side effects (see WARNINGS ) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects, but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10-12.5 or lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20-12.5. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2-3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar or greater blood pressure control with less potassium loss if they are switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10-12.5. Dosage higher than lisinopril 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg should not be used. Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components. Use in Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of therapy with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets need not be adjusted as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (serum creatinine approximately less than or equal to 3 mg/dL or 265 μmol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure ).","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk. (See WARNINGS .) In considering use of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, it should be noted that Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-Black. (See WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema .)","OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued and the patient observed closely. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage, and correction of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and hypotension by established procedures. Lisinopril Following a single oral dose of 20 g/kg no lethality occurred in rats and death occurred in one of 20 mice receiving the same dose. The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension, for which the usual treatment would be intravenous infusion of normal saline solution. Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid reaction during membrane exposure ). Hydrochlorothiazide Oral administration of a single oral dose of 10 g/kg to mice and rats was not lethal. The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis.

It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable And Must Be Individualized On The Basis Of The Disease Under Treatment And The Response Of The Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS : Neuro-Psychiatric ). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg/m2bsa/day). For the purpose of comparison, the fo ll owing is the equivalent mi lli gram dosage of the various corticosteroids: Dexamethasone, 1.5 Methylprednisolone, 8 Prednisone, 10 Triamcinolone, 8 Prednisolone, 10 Betamethasone, 1.5 Hydrocortisone, 40 Paramethasone, 4 Cortisone, 50 These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered. In acute, self-limited allergic disorders or acute exacerbations of chronic allergic disorders, the following dosage schedule combining parenteral and oral therapy is suggested: Dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection, 4 mg per mL First Day 1 or 2 mL, intramuscularly Dexamethasone tablets, 0.75 mg Second Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Third Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Fourth Day 2 tablets in two divided doses Fifth Day 1 tablet Sixth Day 1 tablet Seventh Day No treatment Eighth Day Follow-up visit This schedule is designed to ensure adequate therapy during acute episodes, while minimizing the risk of overdosage in chronic cases. In cerebral edema , dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection is generally administered initially in a dosage of 10 mg intravenously followed by 4 mg every six hours intramuscularly until the symptoms of cerebral edema subside. Response is usually noted within 12 to 24 hours and dosage may be reduced after two to four days and gradually discontinued over a period of five to seven days. For pal l iative management of patients with recurrent or inoperable brain tumors, maintenance therapy with either dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection or dexamethasone tablets in a dosage of 2 mg two or three times daily may be effective. Dexamethasone Suppression Tests 1. Tests for Cushing’s syndrome Give 1.0 mg of dexamethasone orally at 11:00 p.m. Blood is drawn for plasma cortisol determination at 8:00 a.m. the following morning. For greater accuracy, give 0.5 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine co l ections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion. 2. Test to distinguish Cushing’s syndrome due to pituitary ACTH excess from Cushing’s syndrome due to other causes. Give 2.0 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine co l ections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE A l l ergic States: Control of severe or incapacitating a llergic conditions intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment in asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis, and serum sickness.

For the treatment of dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.","WARNINGS General Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation. Cardio-Renal Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, sodium and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients. Endocrine Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for corticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids and may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. If the patient is receiving steroids already, dosage may have to be increased. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. Infections General: Patients who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infection with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic) in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. These infections may be mild to severe. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of current infection. Fungal Infections: Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections unless they are needed to control life-threatening drug reactions. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions: Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents ). Special Pathogens: Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Amoeba, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma. It is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or any patient with unexplained diarrhea. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid- induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral malaria. Tuberculosis: The use of corticosteroids in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination: Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Ki l ed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted. Immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for Addison's disease. Viral infections: Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immune globulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for VZIG and IG for complete prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be considered. Ophthalmic: Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex.","Advanced Rx Pharmacy of Tennessee, LLC",DEXAMETHASONE

The recommended dose is reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days Dose should be adjusted in patients with reduced renal function ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) 2.1 Dosage for Postherpetic Neuralgia In adults with postherpetic neuralgia, Gabapentin may be initiated on Day 1 as a single 300 mg dose, on Day 2 as 600 mg/day (300 mg two times a day), and on Day 3 as 900 mg/day (300 mg three times a day). The dose can subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a dose of 1800 mg/day (600 mg three times a day). In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with comparable effects across the dose range; however, in these clinical studies, the additional benefit of using doses greater than 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated 2.2 Dosage for Epilepsy with Partial Onset Seizures Patients 12 years of age and above The starting dose is 300 mg three times a day. The recommended maintenance dose of Gabapentin is 300 mg to 600 mg three times a day. Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies. Doses of 3600 mg/day have also been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short duration, and have been well tolerated. Administer Gabapentin three times a day using 300 mg or 400 mg capsules. The maximum time between doses should not exceed 12 hours. Pediatric Patients Age 3 to 11 years The starting dose range is 10 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses, and the recommended maintenance dose reached by upward titration over a period of approximately 3 days. The recommended maintenance dose of Gabapentin in patients 3 to 4 years of age is 40 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. The recommended maintenance dose of Gabapentin in patients 5 to 11 years of age is 25 mg/kg/day to 35 mg/kg/day, given in three divided doses. Gabapentin may be administered as the capsule formulations. Dosages up to 50 mg/kg/day have been well tolerated in a long-term clinical study. The maximum time interval between doses should not exceed 12 hours. 2.3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment in patients 12 years of age and older with renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis is recommended, as follows (see dosing recommendations above for effective doses in each indication): TABLE 1.

MORPHINE,N/A,N/A,Paraplegia,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 ) Intravenous Adult Dosage: The usual dose for administration to adults, via a compatible Alaris ® infusion device, is a 1 mg bolus, with a range of 0.2 to 3 mg per incremental dose. The recommended Lockout Interval is 6 minutes. ( 2.2 ) Do not stop Morphine Sulfate Injection abruptly in a physically dependent patient. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Preservative-free Morphine Sulfate Injection is for intravenous administration. It should be used with a compatible Alaris ® infusion device. Morphine Sulfate Injection is for use with Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) infusion device. Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Avoid dosing errors that may result from confusion between mg and mL and confusion with morphine injections of different concentrations when prescribing, dispensing, and administering Morphine Sulfate Injection. Ensure that the proper dose is communicated and dispensed accurately. Each vial is intended for SINGLE USE ONLY. When the dosing requirement is completed, the unused portion should be discarded in an appropriate manner. Physicians should completely familiarize themselves with the Alaris ® infusion device before prescribing preservative-free Morphine Sulfate Injection. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [ see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with Morphine Sulfate Injection and adjust the dosage accordingly [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Administration of Morphine Sulfate Injection should be limited to use by those familiar with the management of respiratory depression. Morphine must be injected slowly; rapid intravenous administration may result in chest wall rigidity. Parenteral drug products should be inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. DO NOT HEAT-STERILIZE. Do not use if color is darker than pale yellow, if it is discolored in any other way, or if it contains a precipitate. 2.2 Initial Dosage Intravenous Administration For use in a compatible Alaris ® infusion device, dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain and the response of the patient. Patients must be closely monitored because of the considerable variability in both the dosage requirements and patient response. Following are recommendations that have to be individualized for each patient. Intravenous Adult Dosage The usual dose for administration to adults, via a compatible Alaris ® infusion device, is a 1 mg bolus, with a range of 0.2 to 3 mg per incremental dose. The recommended Lockout Interval is 6 minutes. The physician may adjust the dosage either upward or downward [ see Individualization of Dosage ]; depending on patient response. Occasionally, it may be necessary to exceed the usual dosage in cases of exceptionally severe pain or in those patients who become tolerant. Individualization of Dosage The mean morphine self-administration rate observed in controlled clinical trials ranged from 1-10 mg/h, depending on the nature of the pain, the degree of opioid tolerance developed by the patient, and the individual patient factors. Most patients will achieve adequate analgesia with a 1 mg bolus and a six minute lockout, although patients with a high degree of opioid tolerance may require a larger bolus size to be comfortable without excessively frequent triggering of the device. In such patients, a bolus size of 2-3 mg is usually adequate, although up to a 5 mg bolus has been used in opioid-tolerant patients in some studies. Although the lockout interval may be varied, most investigators have left it at 6 minutes to facilitate easy calculation of the maximal dosing rate. For opioid-naive patients, the combination of dosing rate and lockout should not permit a maximal dosing rate greater than 10 mg/h (1 mg possible every 6 minutes), while for opioid-tolerant patients maximal dosing rates up to 30 mg/h are common (3 mg every 6 minutes) and greater rates may be needed in selected patients. 2.3 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Individually titrate Morphine Sulfate Injection to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Morphine Sulfate Injection to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions. 2.4 Discontinuation of Morphine Sulfate Injection When a patient who has been taking Morphine Sulfate Injection regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Morphine Sulfate Injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue Morphine Sulfate Injection in a physically-dependent patient [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ].","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Morphine Sulfate Injection is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require use of an opioid analgesic by Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA), and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Preservative-free Morphine Sulfate Injection is for administration via a compatible Alaris ® infusion device. Morphine Sulfate Injection is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require use of an opioid analgesic by Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA), and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use ( 1 ) Only for use with a compatible Alaris ® infusion device.","10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Acute overdose with Morphine Sulfate Injection can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Treatment of Overdose In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to morphine overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to morphine overdose. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of morphine in Morphine Sulfate Injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.","International Medication Systems, Limited",MORPHINE SULFATE

COLCHICINE,69,801,Pericarditis,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The long-term use of colchicine is established for FMF and the prophylaxis of gout flares, but the safety and efficacy of repeat treatment for gout flares has not been evaluated. The dosing regimens for colchicine tablets are different for each indication and must be individualized. The recommended dosage of colchicine tablets depends on the patient’s age, renal function, hepatic function and use of coadministered drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.5 , 2.6) ] . Colchicine tablets are administered orally without regard to meals. Colchicine tablets are not an analgesic medication and should not be used to treat pain from other causes. • Gout Flares: Prophylaxis of Gout Flares: 0.6 mg once or twice daily in adults and adolescents older than 16 years of age ( 2.1 ). Maximum dose 1.2 mg/day. Treatment of Gout Flares: 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of a gout flare followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later ( 2.1 ). • FMF: Adults and children older than 12 years 1.2 - 2.4 mg; children 6 to 12 years 0.9 - 1.8 mg; children 4 to 6 years 0.3 - 1.8 mg ( 2.2 , 2.3 ). o Give total daily dose in one or two divided doses ( 2.2 ). o Increase or decrease the dose as indicated and as tolerated in increments of 0.3 mg/day, not to exceed the maximum recommended daily dose ( 2.2 ). • Colchicine tablets are administered orally without regard to meals. • See full prescribing information (FPI) for dose adjustment regarding patients with impaired renal function ( 2.5 ), impaired hepatic function ( 2.6 ), the patient’s age ( 2.3 , 8.5 ) or use of coadministered drugs ( 2.4 ). 2.1 Gout Flares Prophylaxis of Gout Flares The recommended dosage of colchicine tablets for prophylaxis of gout flares for adults and adolescents older than 16 years of age is 0.6 mg once or twice daily. The maximum recommended dose for prophylaxis of gout flares is 1.2 mg/day. An increase in gout flares may occur after initiation of uric acid-lowering therapy, including pegloticase, febuxostat and allopurinol, due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Colchicine tablets are recommended upon initiation of gout flare prophylaxis with uric acid-lowering therapy. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for at least the first six months of uric acid-lowering therapy. Treatment of Gout Flares The recommended dose of colchicine tablets for treatment of a gout flare is 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of the flare followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later. Higher doses have not been found to be more effective. The maximum recommended dose for treatment of gout flares is 1.8 mg over a 1-hour period. Colchicine tablets may be administered for treatment of a gout flare during prophylaxis at doses not to exceed 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of the flare followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later. Wait 12 hours and then resume the prophylactic dose. 2.2 FMF The recommended dosage of colchicine tablets for FMF in adults is 1.2 mg to 2.4 mg daily. Colchicine tablets should be increased as needed to control disease and as tolerated in increments of 0.3 mg/day to a maximum recommended daily dose. If intolerable side effects develop, the dose should be decreased in increments of 0.3 mg/day. The total daily colchicine tablets dose may be administered in one to two divided doses. 2.3 Recommended Pediatric Dosage Prophylaxis and Treatment of Gout Flares Colchicine tablets are not recommended for pediatric use in prophylaxis or treatment of gout flares. FMF The recommended dosage of colchicine tablets for FMF in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is based on age. The following daily doses may be given as a single or divided dose twice daily: • Children 4 to 6 years: 0.3 mg to 1.8 mg daily • Children 6 to 12 years: 0.9 mg to 1.8 mg daily • Adolescents older than 12 years: 1.2 mg to 2.4 mg daily 2.4 Dose Modification for Coadministration of Interacting Drugs Concomitant Therapy Coadministration of colchicine tablets with drugs known to inhibit CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increases the risk of colchicine-induced toxic effects (Table 1) .

However, in patients with severe impairment, while the dose does not need to be adjusted for the treatment of gout flares, a treatment course should be repeated no more than once every two weeks. For patients with gout flares requiring repeated courses, consideration should be given to alternate therapy. For patients undergoing dialysis, the total recommended dose for the treatment of gout flares should be reduced to a single dose of 0.6 mg (one tablet).

Fatalities have occurred after ingestion of a dose as low as 7 mg over a four day period, while other patients have survived after ingesting more than 60 mg. A review of 150 patients who overdosed on colchicine found that those who ingested less than 0.5 mg/kg survived and tended to have milder toxicities such as gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas those who took 0.5 to 0.8 mg/kg had more severe reactions such as myelosuppression. There was 100% mortality in those who ingested more than 0.8 mg/kg. The first stage of acute colchicine toxicity typically begins within 24 hours of ingestion and includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and significant fluid loss, leading to volume depletion. Peripheral leukocytosis may also be seen. Life-threatening complications occur during the second stage, which occurs 24 to 72 hours after drug administration, attributed to multiorgan failure and its consequences. Death is usually a result of respiratory depression and cardiovascular collapse. If the patient survives, recovery of multiorgan injury may be accompanied by rebound leukocytosis and alopecia starting about one week after the initial ingestion. Treatment of colchicine poisoning should begin with gastric lavage and measures to prevent shock. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic and supportive. No specific antidote is known. Colchicine is not effectively removed by dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .",Proficient Rx LP,COLCHICINE

PREDNISONE,69,801,Pericarditis,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT ® (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing’s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1¼ to 1½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1.

Miscellaneous Tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement","WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing’s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1¼ to 1½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1.

Miscellaneous Tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement","WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

AZATHIOPRINE,69,801,Pericarditis,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Renal Homotransplantation The dose of azathioprine tablets required to prevent rejection and minimize toxicity will vary with individual patients; this necessitates careful management. The initial dose is usually 3 to 5 mg/kg daily, beginning at the time of transplant. Azathioprine tablets are usually given as a single daily dose on the day of, and in a minority of cases 1 to 3 days before, transplantation. Dose reduction to maintenance levels of 1 to 3 mg/kg daily is usually possible. The dose of azathioprine tablets should not be increased to toxic levels because of threatened rejection. Discontinuation may be necessary for severe hematologic or other toxicity, even if rejection of the homograft may be a consequence of drug withdrawal. Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine tablets are usually given on a daily basis. The initial dose should be approximately 1.0 mg/kg (50 to 100 mg) given as a single dose or on a twice-daily schedule. The dose may be increased, beginning at 6 to 8 weeks and thereafter by steps at 4-week intervals, if there are no serious toxicities and if initial response is unsatisfactory. Dose increments should be 0.5 mg/kg daily, up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg/kg per day. Therapeutic response occurs after several weeks of treatment, usually 6 to 8; an adequate trial should be a minimum of 12 weeks. Patients not improved after 12 weeks can be considered refractory. Azathioprine tablets may be continued long-term in patients with clinical response, but patients should be monitored carefully, and gradual dosage reduction should be attempted to reduce risk of toxicities. Maintenance therapy should be at the lowest effective dose, and the dose given can be lowered decrementally with changes of 0.5 mg/kg or approximately 25 mg daily every 4 weeks while other therapy is kept constant. The optimum duration of maintenance azathioprine tablets has not been determined. Azathioprine tablets can be discontinued abruptly, but delayed effects are possible. Patients with TPMT and/or NUDT15 Deficiency Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe bone marrow toxicities. Early drug discontinuation may be considered in patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , WARNINGS: Cytopenias , and PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ). Homozygous deficiency in either TPMT or NUDT15 Because of the risk of increased toxicity, consider alternative therapies for patients who are known to have TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , WARNINGS: Cytopenias , and PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ). Heterozygous deficiency in TPMT and/or NUDT15 Because of the risk of increased toxicity, dosage reduction is recommended in patients known to have heterozygous deficiency of TPMT or NUDT15. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency may require more substantial dosage reductions (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , WARNINGS: Cytopenias , and PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ). Use in Renal Dysfunction Relatively oliguric patients, especially those with tubular necrosis in the immediate postcadaveric transplant period, may have delayed clearance of azathioprine tablets or its metabolites, may be particularly sensitive to this drug, and are usually given lower doses. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of this immunosuppressive antimetabolite drug should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 15-21 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azathioprine tablets, USP are indicated as an adjunct for the prevention of rejection in renal homotransplantation. It is also indicated for the management of active rheumatoid arthritis to reduce signs and symptoms. Renal Homotransplantation Azathioprine tablets, USP are indicated as an adjunct for the prevention of rejection in renal homotransplantation. Experience with over 16,000 transplants shows a 5-year patient survival of 35% to 55%, but this is dependent on donor, match for HLA antigens, anti-donor or anti-B-cell alloantigen antibody, and other variables. The effect of azathioprine tablets on these variables has not been tested in controlled trials. Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to reduce signs and symptoms. Aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or low dose glucocorticoids may be continued during treatment with azathioprine tablets. The combined use of azathioprine tablets with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has not been studied for either added benefit or unexpected adverse effects. The use of azathioprine tablets with these agents cannot be recommended.","OVERDOSAGE The oral LD 50 s for single doses of azathioprine tablets in mice and rats are 2500 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, respectively.

Weight based dosage in adults and pediatric patients: 13 mg/kg (10 mg/kg base), not to exceed 800 mg (620 mg base) followed by 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base), not to exceed 400 mg (310 mg base), at 6 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after the initial dose. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate film-coated tablets cannot be divided, therefore they should not be used to treat patients who weigh less than 31 kg. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. malariae infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary. Lupus Erythematosus The recommended adult dosage is 200 to 400 mg (155 to 310 mg base) daily, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses. Doses above 400 mg a day are not recommended. The incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is exceeded. Rheumatoid Arthritis The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Initial adult dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg (310 to 465 mg base) daily, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses. In a small percentage of patients, side effects may require temporary reduction of the initial dosage. Maintenance adult dosage: When a good response is obtained, the dosage may be reduced by 50 percent and continued at a maintenance level of 200 mg to 400 mg (155 to 310 mg base) daily, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses. Do not exceed 600 mg or 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) per day, whichever is lower, as the incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is exceeded. Corticosteroids and salicylates may be used in conjunction with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, and they can generally be decreased gradually in dosage or eliminated after a maintenance dose of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets has been achieved.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Malaria Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax . Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported. Limitations of Use in Malaria Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for the treatment of complicated malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not effective against chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology ). Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for the treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for malaria prophylaxis in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets do not prevent relapses of P. vivax or P.ovale because they are ot active against the hypnozoite forms of these parasites. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology ). Prior to prescribing Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria, consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Malaria website (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria). Lupus Erythematosus Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus in adults. Rheumatoid Arthritis Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults.","OVERDOSAGE The 4-aminoquinoline compounds are very rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion, and in accidental overdosage, or rarely with lower doses in hypersensitive patients, toxic symptoms may occur within 30 minutes. The symptoms of overdosage may include headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, hypokalemia, rhythm and conduction disorders including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest. Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt. Immediate gastric lavage until the stomach is completely emptied is indicated. After lavage, activated charcoal is introduced by the stomach tube within 30 minutes of ingestion of the drug may inhibit further intestinal absorption. To be effective, the dose of activated charcoal should be at least five times the estimated dose of hydroxychloroquine ingested. Consideration should be given to administering diazepam parenterally since studies suggest that it may be beneficial in reversing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity. Respiratory support and shock management should be instituted as necessary. Exchange transfusions are used to reduce the level of 4-aminoquinoline drug in the blood. A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed for at least six hours. Fluids may be forced and sufficient ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) may be administered for a few days to acidify the urine. This will promote urinary excretion in cases of both overdosage and sensitivity. However, caution must be exercised in patients with impaired renal function and/or metabolic acidosis.","Aphena Pharma Solutions - Tennessee, LLC",HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE

For most osteoporotic men, the appropriate dose is FOSAMAX PLUS D (70 mg alendronate/5600 international units vitamin D 3 ) once weekly. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients to do the following: Take FOSAMAX PLUS D at least one-half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water only [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ] . Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking FOSAMAX PLUS D with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other medications will lessen the effect of alendronate by decreasing its absorption into the body. Take FOSAMAX PLUS D upon arising for the day. To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, a FOSAMAX PLUS D tablet should be swallowed with a full glass of water (6-8 ounces). Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their first food of the day. FOSAMAX PLUS D should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse experiences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ] . 2.4 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home bound, or chronically ill) may need additional vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

In males, these values were slightly higher, 626 and 1280 mg/kg, respectively. There was no lethality in dogs at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg (4000 mg/m 2 ). No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with alendronate. Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer, may result from oral overdosage. Milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate. Due to the risk of esophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright. Dialysis would not be beneficial. Cholecalciferol Significant lethality occurred in mice treated with a single high oral dose of calcitriol (4 mg/kg), the hormonal metabolite of cholecalciferol. There is limited information regarding doses of cholecalciferol associated with acute toxicity, although intermittent (yearly or twice yearly) single doses of ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2 ) as high as 600,000 international units have been given without reports of toxicity. Signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, weakness, and lethargy.

For most osteoporotic men, the appropriate dose is FOSAMAX PLUS D (70 mg alendronate/5600 international units vitamin D 3 ) once weekly. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients to do the following: Take FOSAMAX PLUS D at least one-half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water only [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ] . Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking FOSAMAX PLUS D with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other medications will lessen the effect of alendronate by decreasing its absorption into the body. Take FOSAMAX PLUS D upon arising for the day. To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, a FOSAMAX PLUS D tablet should be swallowed with a full glass of water (6-8 ounces). Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their first food of the day. FOSAMAX PLUS D should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse experiences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2) ] . 2.4 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home bound, or chronically ill) may need additional vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered. The recommended intake of vitamin D is 400-800 international units daily. FOSAMAX PLUS D 70 mg/2800 international units and 70 mg/5600 international units are intended to provide seven days' worth of 400 and 800 international units daily vitamin D in a single, once-weekly dose, respectively. 2.5 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses If a once-weekly dose of FOSAMAX PLUS D is missed, instruct patients to take one tablet on the morning after they remember. They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOSAMAX PLUS D is a combination of a bisphosphonate and vitamin D indicated for: Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 1.1 ) Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitations of use: FOSAMAX PLUS D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency. ( 1.3 ) Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women FOSAMAX ® PLUS D is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, FOSAMAX PLUS D increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1.2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis FOSAMAX PLUS D is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 1.3 Important Limitations of Use FOSAMAX PLUS D alone should not be used to treat vitamin D deficiency. The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of FOSAMAX PLUS D for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.","10 OVERDOSAGE Alendronate Sodium Significant lethality after single oral doses with alendronate was seen in female rats and mice at 552 mg/kg (3256 mg/m 2 ) and 966 mg/kg (2898 mg/m 2 ), respectively. In males, these values were slightly higher, 626 and 1280 mg/kg, respectively. There was no lethality in dogs at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg (4000 mg/m 2 ). No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with alendronate. Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer, may result from oral overdosage. Milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate. Due to the risk of esophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright. Dialysis would not be beneficial. Cholecalciferol Significant lethality occurred in mice treated with a single high oral dose of calcitriol (4 mg/kg), the hormonal metabolite of cholecalciferol. There is limited information regarding doses of cholecalciferol associated with acute toxicity, although intermittent (yearly or twice yearly) single doses of ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2 ) as high as 600,000 international units have been given without reports of toxicity. Signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, weakness, and lethargy. Serum and urine calcium levels should be monitored in patients with suspected vitamin D toxicity. Standard therapy includes restriction of dietary calcium, hydration, and systemic glucocorticoids in patients with severe hypercalcemia.

(2.1) In patients with at least 2 of the following characteristics: age greater than or equal to 80 years, body weight less than or equal to 60 kg, or serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg orally twice daily. (2.1) Prophylaxis of DVT following hip or knee replacement surgery: The recommended dose is 2.5 mg orally twice daily. (2.1) Treatment of DVT and PE: The recommended dose is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg taken orally twice daily. (2.1) Reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy: The recommended dose is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. (2.1) 2.1 Recommended Dose Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation The recommended dose of ELIQUIS for most patients is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics: age greater than or equal to 80 years body weight less than or equal to 60 kg serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily. The initial dose should be taken 12 to 24 hours after surgery. In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days. In patients undergoing knee replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 12 days. Treatment of DVT and PE The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. After 7 days, the recommended dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE The recommended dose of ELIQUIS is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . 2.2 Missed Dose If a dose of ELIQUIS is not taken at the scheduled time, the dose should be taken as soon as possible on the same day and twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to make up for a missed dose. 2.3 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established. 2.4 Converting from or to ELIQUIS Switching from warfarin to ELIQUIS: Warfarin should be discontinued and ELIQUIS started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0. Switching from ELIQUIS to warfarin: ELIQUIS affects INR, so that initial INR measurements during the transition to warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range. Switching from ELIQUIS to anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral): Discontinue ELIQUIS and begin taking the new anticoagulant other than warfarin at the usual time of the next dose of ELIQUIS. Switching from anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral) to ELIQUIS: Discontinue the anticoagulant other than warfarin and begin taking ELIQUIS at the usual time of the next dose of the anticoagulant other than warfarin. 2.5 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors For patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.6 Administration Options For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, 5 mg and 2.5 mg ELIQUIS tablets may be crushed and suspended in water, 5% dextrose in water (D5W), or apple juice, or mixed with applesauce and promptly administered orally [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Alternatively, ELIQUIS tablets may be crushed and suspended in 60 mL of water or D5W and promptly delivered through a nasogastric tube [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

AUVELITY is a combination of dextromethorphan, an uncompetitive N -methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist, and bupropion, an aminoketone and CYP450 2D6 inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. ( 1 )","10 OVERDOSAGE Human Experience There is limited clinical study experience regarding human overdosage with AUVELITY. Overdosage information is based on experience with the individual components, dextromethorphan and bupropion. Metabolism of the dextromethorphan component of AUVELITY is inhibited by the bupropion component, such that overdose due to AUVELITY might be more severe or more persistent compared to overdose of dextromethorphan alone. Dextromethorphan Symptoms of dextromethorphan overdose include nausea, vomiting, stupor, coma, respiratory depression, seizures, tachycardia, hyperexcitability, and toxic psychosis. Other adverse effects include ataxia, nystagmus, dystonia, blurred vision, and changes in muscle reflexes. Dextromethorphan may cause serotonin syndrome, and this risk is increased by overdose, particularly if taken with other serotonergic agents, SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants. Bupropion Overdoses of up to 30 grams or more of bupropion (approximately 143 times the maximum recommended dose of AUVELITY) have been reported. Seizure was reported in approximately one-third of all cases. Other serious reactions reported with overdoses of bupropion alone included hallucinations, loss of consciousness, mental status changes, sinus tachycardia, ECG changes such as conduction disturbances (including QRS prolongation) or arrhythmias, clonus, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia. Fever, muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported mainly when bupropion was part of multiple drug overdoses. Although most patients recovered without sequelae, deaths associated with overdoses of bupropion alone have been reported in patients ingesting large doses of the drug. Multiple uncontrolled seizures, bradycardia, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest prior to death were reported in these patients. Overdosage Management Treatment of dextromethorphan overdosage should be directed at symptomatic and supportive measures. There are no known antidotes for bupropion. In case of an overdose, provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdose. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for overdosage management recommendations for AUVELITY.","Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.","DEXTROMETHORPHAN HYDROBROMIDE, BUPROPION HYDROCHLORIDE"

A gradual withdrawal of the concomitant AED over at least 6 weeks is recommended. 2.4 Dosage Information for Patients with Renal Impairment For patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary. For patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CL CR ) less than 30 mL/min as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation for adults; CL CR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 as estimated by the Schwartz equation for pediatric patients] or end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25% of the maximum dosage is recommended. In all patients with renal impairment, dose initiation and titration should be based on clinical response and tolerability. Hemodialysis VIMPAT is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Following a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment, dosage supplementation of up to 50% should be considered. Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 Inhibitors Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with renal impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Dosage Information for Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, a reduction of 25% of the maximum dosage is recommended. The dose initiation and titration should be based on clinical response and tolerability in patients with hepatic impairment. VIMPAT use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 Inhibitors Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.6 Administration Instructions for VIMPAT Tablets and Oral Solution VIMPAT tablets and oral solution may be taken with or without food. VIMPAT Tablets VIMPAT tablets should be swallowed whole with liquid. Do not divide VIMPAT tablets. VIMPAT Oral Solution A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. VIMPAT oral solution may also be administered using a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube. Discard any unused VIMPAT oral solution remaining after 6 months of first opening the bottle. 2.7 Preparation and Administration Information for VIMPAT Injection Preparation VIMPAT injection can be administered intravenously without further dilution or may be mixed with diluents listed below. The diluted solution should not be stored for more than 4 hours at room temperature. Diluents: Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% (w/v) Dextrose Injection 5% (w/v) Lactated Ringer's Injection Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Product with particulate matter or discoloration should not be used. VIMPAT injection is for single-dose only. Any unused portion of VIMPAT injection should be discarded. Administration The recommended infusion duration is 30 to 60 minutes; however, infusions as rapid as 15 minutes can be administered in adults if required [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Infusion durations less than 30 minutes are generally not recommended in pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Intravenous infusion of VIMPAT may cause bradycardia, AV blocks, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose is recommended in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions or on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Storage and Stability The diluted solution should not be stored for more than 4 hours at room temperature. Any unused portion of VIMPAT injection should be discarded. 2.8 Discontinuation of VIMPAT When discontinuing VIMPAT, a gradual withdrawal over at least 1 week is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] .",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE VIMPAT is indicated for: Treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older ( 1.1 ) Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Partial-Onset Seizures VIMPAT is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older. 1.2 Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures VIMPAT is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older.,"10 OVERDOSAGE Events reported after an intake of more than 800 mg (twice the maximum recommended daily dosage) of VIMPAT include dizziness, nausea, and seizures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus). Cardiac conduction disorders, confusion, decreased level of consciousness, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and coma have also been observed. Fatalities have occurred following lacosamide overdoses of several grams. There is no specific antidote for overdose with VIMPAT. Standard decontamination procedures should be followed. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of patient. A Certified Poison Control Center should be contacted for up to date information on the management of overdose with VIMPAT. Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of VIMPAT (reduction of systemic exposure by 50% in 4 hours). Hemodialysis may be indicated based on the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.","UCB, Inc.",LACOSAMIDE

DEXAMETHASONE,N/A,N/A,Rash,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Oral Administration The initial dosage varies from 0.75 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated. It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable And Must Be Individualized On The Basis Of The Disease Under Treatment And The Response Of The Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS : Neuro-Psychiatric ). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg/m2bsa/day). For the purpose of comparison, the fo ll owing is the equivalent mi lli gram dosage of the various corticosteroids: Dexamethasone, 1.5 Methylprednisolone, 8 Prednisone, 10 Triamcinolone, 8 Prednisolone, 10 Betamethasone, 1.5 Hydrocortisone, 40 Paramethasone, 4 Cortisone, 50 These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered. In acute, self-limited allergic disorders or acute exacerbations of chronic allergic disorders, the following dosage schedule combining parenteral and oral therapy is suggested: Dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection, 4 mg per mL First Day 1 or 2 mL, intramuscularly Dexamethasone tablets, 0.75 mg Second Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Third Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Fourth Day 2 tablets in two divided doses Fifth Day 1 tablet Sixth Day 1 tablet Seventh Day No treatment Eighth Day Follow-up visit This schedule is designed to ensure adequate therapy during acute episodes, while minimizing the risk of overdosage in chronic cases. In cerebral edema , dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection is generally administered initially in a dosage of 10 mg intravenously followed by 4 mg every six hours intramuscularly until the symptoms of cerebral edema subside. Response is usually noted within 12 to 24 hours and dosage may be reduced after two to four days and gradually discontinued over a period of five to seven days. For pal l iative management of patients with recurrent or inoperable brain tumors, maintenance therapy with either dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection or dexamethasone tablets in a dosage of 2 mg two or three times daily may be effective. Dexamethasone Suppression Tests 1. Tests for Cushing’s syndrome Give 1.0 mg of dexamethasone orally at 11:00 p.m. Blood is drawn for plasma cortisol determination at 8:00 a.m. the following morning. For greater accuracy, give 0.5 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine co l ections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion. 2. Test to distinguish Cushing’s syndrome due to pituitary ACTH excess from Cushing’s syndrome due to other causes. Give 2.0 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine co l ections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE A l l ergic States: Control of severe or incapacitating a llergic conditions intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment in asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis, and serum sickness.

For the treatment of dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.","WARNINGS General Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation. Cardio-Renal Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, sodium and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients. Endocrine Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for corticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids and may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. If the patient is receiving steroids already, dosage may have to be increased. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. Infections General: Patients who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infection with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic) in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. These infections may be mild to severe. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of current infection. Fungal Infections: Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections unless they are needed to control life-threatening drug reactions. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions: Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents ). Special Pathogens: Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Amoeba, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma. It is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or any patient with unexplained diarrhea. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid- induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral malaria. Tuberculosis: The use of corticosteroids in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination: Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Ki l ed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted. Immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for Addison's disease. Viral infections: Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immune globulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for VZIG and IG for complete prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be considered. Ophthalmic: Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex.","Advanced Rx Pharmacy of Tennessee, LLC",DEXAMETHASONE

In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/ day for up to 6 months. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen tablets may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate. Recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis Recommended starting dose 550 mg of naproxen sodium as naproxen sodium tablets followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Naproxen sodium tablets are recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Acute Gout Recommended starting dose 750 mg of naproxen tablets followed by 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium tablets may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg followed by 275 mg every 8 hours. 2.1 General Dosing Instructions Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ]. After observing the response to initial therapy with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs. Naproxen-containing products such as naproxen and naproxen sodium tablets, and other naproxen products should not be used concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion. 2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dosages of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Recommended dosages for naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets Naproxen tablets 250 mg (one half tablet) 500 mg twice daily Naproxen sodium tablets 275 mg (one half tablet) 550 mg (naproxen 500 mg with 50 mg sodium) twice daily During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response. In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk. 2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen solid-oral dosage forms may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate for weight-based dosing and due to the need for dose flexibility in children. In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ]. The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. 2.4 Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis The recommended starting dose of naproxen sodium tablets is 550 mg followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg (one half of a 550 mg tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg (two and one-half tablets) of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium.

It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 , 5.6 ) ]. Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

Fycompa tablets,76,801,Seizure,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis Naproxen tablets 250 mg (one-half tablet) 500 mg twice daily Naproxen sodium tablets 275 mg (one-half tablet) 550 mg twice daily The dose may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/ day for up to 6 months. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen tablets may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate. Recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis Recommended starting dose 550 mg of naproxen sodium as naproxen sodium tablets followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Naproxen sodium tablets are recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Acute Gout Recommended starting dose 750 mg of naproxen tablets followed by 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium tablets may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg followed by 275 mg every 8 hours. 2.1 General Dosing Instructions Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ]. After observing the response to initial therapy with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs. Naproxen-containing products such as naproxen and naproxen sodium tablets, and other naproxen products should not be used concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion. 2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dosages of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Recommended dosages for naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets Naproxen tablets 250 mg (one half tablet) 500 mg twice daily Naproxen sodium tablets 275 mg (one half tablet) 550 mg (naproxen 500 mg with 50 mg sodium) twice daily During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response. In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk. 2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen solid-oral dosage forms may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate for weight-based dosing and due to the need for dose flexibility in children. In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ]. The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. 2.4 Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis The recommended starting dose of naproxen sodium tablets is 550 mg followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg (one half of a 550 mg tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg (two and one-half tablets) of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Because the sodium salt of naproxen is more rapidly absorbed, naproxen sodium tablets is recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Naproxen tablets may also be used. The recommended starting dose of naproxen tablets is 500 mg followed by 250 mg (one half of a 500 mg naproxen tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The total daily dose should not exceed 1250 mg of naproxen. 2.5 Acute Gout The recommended starting dose is 750 mg (one and one-half tablets) of naproxen tablets followed by 250 mg (one-half tablet) every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium tablets may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg (one and one-half tablets) followed by 275 mg (one-half tablet) every 8 hours. 2.6 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Naproxen Different dose strengths and formulations (e.g., tablets, suspension) of naproxen are not interchangeable. This difference should be taken into consideration when changing strengths or formulations.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are indicated for: the relief of the signs and symptoms of: • rheumatoid arthritis • osteoarthritis • ankylosing spondylitis • Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are also indicated for: the relief of signs and symptoms of: • tendonitis • bursitis • acute gout the management of: • pain • primary dysmenorrhea Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indicated for: the relief of the signs and symptoms of: • rheumatoid arthritis • osteoarthritis • ankylosing spondylitis • polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis Naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are also indicated for: the relief of signs and symptoms of: • tendonitis • bursitis • acute gout the management of: • pain • primary dysmenorrhea,"10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care.

DIAZEPAM,50,801,Abdominal pain,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of most patients, there will be some who may require higher doses. In such cases dosage should be increased cautiously to avoid adverse effects. ADULTS: USUAL DAILY DOSE: Management of Anxiety Disorders and Relief of Symptoms of Anxiety. Depending upon severity of symptoms—2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily Symptomatic Relief in Acute Alcohol Withdrawal. 10 mg, 3 or 4 times during the first 24 hours, reducing to 5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily as needed. Adjunctively for Relief of Skeletal Muscle Spasm. 2 mg to 10 mg, 3 or 4 times daily Adjunctively in Convulsive Disorders. 2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily Geriatric Patients, or in the presence of debilitating disease. 2 mg to 2.5 mg, 1 or 2 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: Because of varied responses to CNS-acting drugs, initiate therapy with lowest dose and increase as required. Not for use in pediatric patients under 6 months. 1 mg to 2.5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated. Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Diazepam Tablets To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ).","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diazepam tablets are indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic. In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam tablets may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, impending or acute delirium tremens and hallucinosis. Diazepam tablets are a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathology (such as inflammation of the muscles or joints, or secondary to trauma), spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (such as cerebral palsy and paraplegia), athetosis, and stiff-man syndrome. Oral diazepam tablets may be used adjunctively in convulsive disorders, although it has not proved useful as the sole therapy. The effectiveness of diazepam tablets in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.","OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions ). Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage. In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.

PREDNISONE,52,801,Myocardial injury,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT ® (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing’s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1¼ to 1½ days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: 1) Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. 2) ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. 3) In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. 4) Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. 5) As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). 6) The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). 7) In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. 8) In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. 9) Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.","INDICATIONS Prednisone tablets are indicated in the following conditions: 1.

Miscellaneous Tuberculous meningitis with subarachnoid block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous chemotherapy Trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement","WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during their use. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. The use of prednisone in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate anti-tuberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Children who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy children. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children on immunosuppressant corticosteroids. In such children, or in adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.",A-S Medication Solutions,PREDNISONE

LOSARTAN POTASSIUM,83,801,Deafness,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the lowest effective dosage for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis Naproxen tablets 250 mg (one-half tablet) 500 mg twice daily Naproxen sodium tablets 275 mg (one-half tablet) 550 mg twice daily The dose may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/ day for up to 6 months. Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen tablets may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate. Recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis Recommended starting dose 550 mg of naproxen sodium as naproxen sodium tablets followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Naproxen sodium tablets are recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Acute Gout Recommended starting dose 750 mg of naproxen tablets followed by 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium tablets may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg followed by 275 mg every 8 hours. 2.1 General Dosing Instructions Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ]. After observing the response to initial therapy with naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs. Naproxen-containing products such as naproxen and naproxen sodium tablets, and other naproxen products should not be used concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion. 2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dosages of naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Recommended dosages for naproxen tablets and naproxen sodium tablets Naproxen tablets 250 mg (one half tablet) 500 mg twice daily Naproxen sodium tablets 275 mg (one half tablet) 550 mg (naproxen 500 mg with 50 mg sodium) twice daily During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response. In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk. 2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Naproxen solid-oral dosage forms may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate for weight-based dosing and due to the need for dose flexibility in children. In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ]. The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets is not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms. 2.4 Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis The recommended starting dose of naproxen sodium tablets is 550 mg followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg (one half of a 550 mg tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1375 mg (two and one-half tablets) of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1100 mg of naproxen sodium. Because the sodium salt of naproxen is more rapidly absorbed, naproxen sodium tablets is recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired. Naproxen tablets may also be used. The recommended starting dose of naproxen tablets is 500 mg followed by 250 mg (one half of a 500 mg naproxen tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The total daily dose should not exceed 1250 mg of naproxen. 2.5 Acute Gout The recommended starting dose is 750 mg (one and one-half tablets) of naproxen tablets followed by 250 mg (one-half tablet) every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. Naproxen sodium tablets may also be used at a starting dose of 825 mg (one and one-half tablets) followed by 275 mg (one-half tablet) every 8 hours. 2.6 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Naproxen Different dose strengths and formulations (e.g., tablets, suspension) of naproxen are not interchangeable.

Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is one primary cause of “antibiotic-associated colitis”. After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against C. difficile colitis.",Bryant Ranch Prepack,ERYTHROMYCIN

A single dose of BREYANZI contains CAR-positive viable T cells (consisting of 1:1 CAR-positive viable T cells of the CD8 and CD4 components), with each component supplied separately in one to four single-dose vials. See Table 1 for dose range per indication. Table 1: Dose Range Indication BREYANZI dose range LBCL after two or more lines of therapy ( 1.1 ) 50 to 110 × 10 6 CAR-positive viable T cells LBCL after one line of therapy ( 1.1 ) 90 to 110 × 10 6 CAR-positive viable T cells CLL or SLL ( 1.2 ) FL ( 1.3 ) MCL ( 1.4 ) 2.2 Administration BREYANZI is for autologous use only. The patient’s identity must match the patient identifiers on the BREYANZI cartons, vials, and syringe labels. Do not infuse BREYANZI if the information on the patient-specific labels does not match the intended patient. Preparing the Patient for BREYANZI Confirm the availability of BREYANZI before starting lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Pretreatment Administer the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen before infusion of BREYANZI: fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day intravenously (IV), and cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m 2 /day IV for 3 days. See the prescribing information for fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for information on dose adjustment in renal impairment. Infuse BREYANZI 2 to 7 days after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Delay the infusion of BREYANZI if the patient has unresolved serious adverse events from preceding chemotherapies, active uncontrolled infection, or active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Premedication To minimize the risk of infusion reactions, premedicate the patient with acetaminophen (650 mg orally) and diphenhydramine (25-50 mg, IV or orally), or another H1-antihistamine, 30 to 60 minutes prior to treatment with BREYANZI. Avoid prophylactic use of systemic corticosteroids, as they may interfere with the activity of BREYANZI. Receipt of BREYANZI • BREYANZI is shipped directly to the cell-associated lab or clinical pharmacy associated with the infusion center in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrogen shipper. • Confirm the patient’s identity with the patient identifiers on the shipper. • If the patient is not expected to be ready for administration before the shipper expires and the infusion site is qualified for onsite storage, transfer BREYANZI to onsite vapor phase of liquid nitrogen storage prior to preparation. • If the patient is not expected to be ready for administration before the shipper expires and the infusion site is not qualified for onsite storage, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555 to arrange for return shipment. Preparing BREYANZI Before thawing the vials • Confirm the patient’s identity with the patient identifiers on the RFI Certificate. • Read the RFI Certificate (affixed inside the shipper) for information on the number of syringes you will need to administer the CD8 and CD4 components (syringe labels are provided with the RFI Certificate). There is a separate RFI Certificate for each cell component. • Confirm tocilizumab and emergency equipment are available prior to infusion and during the recovery period. • Confirm the infusion time in advance and adjust the start time of BREYANZI thaw such that it will be available for infusion when the patient is ready. Thawing the vials 1. Confirm the patient’s identity with the patient identifiers on the outer carton and on the syringe labels. Once the vials of CAR-positive viable T cells (CD8 component and CD4 component) are removed from frozen storage, the thaw must be carried to completion and the cells administered within 2 hours. 2. Remove the CD8 component carton and CD4 component carton from the outer carton. 3. Confirm the patient’s identity with the patient identifiers on the inner carton. 4. Open each inner carton and visually inspect the vial(s) for damage. If the vials are damaged, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555. 5. Confirm the patient’s identity with the patient identifiers on the vials. 6. Carefully remove the vials from the cartons, place vials on a protective barrier pad, and thaw at room temperature until there is no visible ice in the vials. Thaw all of the vials at the same time. Keep the CD8 and CD4 components separate. Dose preparation • Prepare BREYANZI using sterile technique. • Based on the concentration of CAR-positive viable T cells for each component, more than one vial of each of the CD8 and CD4 components may be required to complete a dose. A separate syringe should be prepared for each CD8 or CD4 component vial received. Note: The volume to be drawn up and infused may differ for each component as indicated on the RFI Certificate. Do NOT draw up excess volume into the syringe. • Each vial contains 5 mL with a total extractable volume of 4.6 mL of CD8 or CD4 component T cells. The RFI Certificate for each component indicates the volume (mL) of cells to be drawn up into each syringe. Use the smallest Luer-lock tip syringe necessary (1, 3, or 5 mL) to draw up the specified volume from each vial. A 5 mL syringe should not be used for volumes less than 3 mL. 7. Prepare the syringe(s) of the CD8 component first. Affix the CD8 syringe labels to the syringe(s) prior to pulling the required volume into the syringe(s). Note: It is important to confirm that the volume drawn up for each component matches the volume specified in the respective RFI Certificate. Do NOT draw up excess volume into the syringe. Withdrawal of the required volume of cells from each vial into a separate syringe should be carried out using the following instructions: 8. Hold the thawed vial(s) upright and gently invert the vial(s) 5 times to mix the cell product. If any clumping is apparent, continue to invert the vial(s) until clumps have dispersed and cells appear to be evenly resuspended. 9. Visually inspect the thawed vial(s) for damage or leaks. Do not use if the vial is damaged or if the clumps do not disperse; contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555. The liquid in the vials should be slightly opaque to opaque, colorless to yellow or brownish-yellow. 10. Remove the polyaluminum cover (if present) from the bottom of the vial and swab the septum with an alcohol wipe. Allow to air dry before proceeding. NOTE: The absence of the polyaluminum cover does not impact the sterility of the vial. 11. Keeping the vial(s) upright, cut the seal on the tubing line on the top of the vial immediately above the filter to open the air vent on the vial. NOTE: Be careful to select the correct tubing line with the filter. Cut ONLY the tubing with a filter. 12. Hold a 20-gauge, 1-1 ½ inch needle, with the opening of the needle tip away from the retrieval port septum. a. Insert the needle into the septum at a 45°- 60° angle to puncture the retrieval port septum. b. Increase the angle of the needle gradually as the needle enters the vial. a b 13. WITHOUT drawing air into the syringe, slowly withdraw the target volume (as specified in the RFI Certificate). Carefully inspect the syringe for signs of debris prior to proceeding. If there is debris, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555. 14. Verify that the volume of CD8/CD4 component matches the volume specified for the relevant component in the RFI Certificate. Once the volume is verified, remove the syringe/needle from the vial, carefully detach the needle from the syringe and cap the syringe. 15. Continue to keep the vial horizontal and return it to the carton to avoid leaking from the vial. 16. Dispose of any unused portion of BREYANZI (according to local biosafety guidelines). 17. Repeat the process steps 7-16 for the CD4 Component. 18. Transport the labeled CD8 and CD4 syringes to the bedside by placing with protective barrier pad inside an insulated room temperature container. Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image BREYANZI Administration • Do NOT use a leukodepleting filter. • Ensure tocilizumab and emergency equipment are available prior to infusion and during the recovery period. • Confirm the patient’s identity matches the patient identifiers on the syringe label. • Once BREYANZI has been drawn into syringes, proceed with administration as soon as possible. The total time from removal from frozen storage to patient administration should not exceed 2 hours as indicated by the time entered on the syringe label. 1. Use intravenous normal saline to flush all the infusion tubing prior to and after each CD8 or CD4 component administration. 2. Administer the entire volume of the CD8 component intravenously at an infusion rate of approximately 0.5 mL/minute, using the closest port or Y-arm. NOTE: The time for infusion will vary but will usually be less than 15 minutes for each component. 3. If more than one syringe is required for a full cell dose of the CD8 component, administer the volume in each syringe consecutively without any time between administering the contents of the syringes (unless there is a clinical reason (e.g., infusion reaction) to hold the dose). 4. After the CD8 component has been administered, flush the tubing with normal saline, using enough volume to clear the tubing and the length of the IV catheter. 5. Administer the CD4 component second, immediately after administration of the CD8 component is complete, using steps 1-4, as described for the CD8 component. Following administration of the CD4 component, flush the tubing with normal saline, using enough volume to clear the tubing and the length of the IV catheter. BREYANZI contains human blood cells that are genetically modified with replication-incompetent, self-inactivating lentiviral vector. Follow universal precautions and local biosafety guidelines applicable for the handling and disposal, to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases. Monitoring • Administer BREYANZI at a REMS-certified healthcare facility. • Monitor patients daily for at least 7 days following BREYANZI infusion at a REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS and neurologic toxicities. • Instruct patients to remain within proximity of the certified healthcare facility for at least 4 weeks following infusion. • Instruct patients to refrain from driving or hazardous activities for at least 8 weeks following infusion. 2.3 Management of Severe Adverse Reactions Cytokine Release Syndrome Identify cytokine release syndrome (CRS) based on clinical presentation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .

Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide may be used alone, or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide is a combination of olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1 )","10 OVERDOSAGE Olmesartan medoxomil Limited data are available related to overdosage of olmesartan medoxomil in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurs. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be initiated. The dialyzability of olmesartan is unknown. No lethality was observed in acute toxicity studies in mice and rats given single oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg olmesartan medoxomil. The minimum lethal oral dose of olmesartan medoxomil in dogs was greater than 1500 mg/kg. Hydrochlorothiazide The most common signs and symptoms of hydrochlorothiazide overdose observed in humans are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established.

Ebanel urea cream,83,801,Deafness,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended starting dose is 1 or 2 mg once daily. Increase in 1 or 2 mg increments no more frequently than every 1 to 2 weeks based on glycemic response. Maximum recommended dose is 8 mg once daily ( 2.1 ). Administer with breakfast or first meal of the day ( 2.1 ). Use 1 mg starting dose and titrate slowly in patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia (e.g., elderly, patients with renal impairment) ( 2.1 ). 2.1 Recommended Dosing Glimepiride tablets should be administered with breakfast or the first main meal of the day. The recommended starting dose of glimepiride tablets are 1 mg or 2 mg once daily. Patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly or patients with renal impairment) should be started on 1 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.6) ]. After reaching a daily dose of 2 mg, further dose increases can be made in increments of 1 mg or 2 mg based upon the patient’s glycemic response. Uptitration should not occur more frequently than every 1 to 2 weeks. A conservative titration scheme is recommended for patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.6) ]. The maximum recommended dose is 8 mg once daily. Patients being transferred to glimepiride tablets from longer half-life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) may have overlapping drug effect for 1 to 2 weeks and should be appropriately monitored for hypoglycemia. When colesevelam is coadministered with glimepiride, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glimepiride is reduced. Therefore, glimepiride tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Glimepiride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Limitations of Use Glimepiride tablets should not be used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Glimepiride tablets are a sulfonylurea indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( 1 ). Limitations of Use: Not for treating type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis ( 1 ).","10 OVERDOSAGE An overdosage of glimepiride tablets, as with other sulfonylureas, can produce severe hypoglycemia. Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can be treated with oral glucose. Severe hypoglycemic reactions constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment. Severe hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurological impairment can be treated with glucagon or intravenous glucose. Continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].",American Health Packaging,GLIMEPIRIDE

Inspect the vial visually under a shielded screen for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Discard the vial if particulates or discoloration are present. Do not inject the PLUVICTO solution directly into any other intravenous solution. Confirm the amount of radioactivity delivered to the patient with an appropriately calibrated dose calibrator prior to and after PLUVICTO administration. Dispose of any unused medicinal product or waste material in accordance with local and federal laws. Administration Instructions The recommended dosage of PLUVICTO may be administered intravenously as an injection using a disposable syringe fitted with a syringe shield (with or without a syringe pump), as an infusion using the gravity method (with or without an infusion pump), or as an infusion using the vial (with a peristaltic infusion pump). A reduced dose of PLUVICTO should be administered using the syringe method (with or without a syringe pump) or the vial method (with a peristaltic infusion pump). Using the gravity method to administer a reduced dose of PLUVICTO is not recommended since it may result in delivery of the incorrect volume of PLUVICTO, if the dose is not adjusted prior to administration. Prior to administration, flush the intravenous catheter used exclusively for PLUVICTO administration with ≥ 10 mL of 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution to ensure patency and to minimize the risk of extravasation. Manage cases of extravasation as per institutional guidelines. Instructions for the Syringe Method (With or Without a Syringe Pump) After disinfecting the vial stopper, withdraw an appropriate volume of PLUVICTO solution to deliver the desired radioactivity by using a disposable syringe fitted with a syringe shield and a disposable sterile needle. Administer PLUVICTO to the patient by slow intravenous push within approximately 1 to 10 minutes (either with a syringe pump or manually without a syringe pump) via an intravenous catheter that is pre-filled with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution and that is used exclusively for PLUVICTO administration to the patient. Once the desired PLUVICTO radioactivity has been administered, perform an intravenous flush of ≥ 10 mL of 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution through the intravenous catheter to the patient. Instructions for the Gravity Method (With or Without an Infusion Pump) Insert a 2.5 cm, 20 gauge needle (short needle) into the PLUVICTO vial and connect via a catheter to 500 mL 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution (used to transport the PLUVICTO solution during the infusion). Ensure that the short needle does not touch the PLUVICTO solution in the vial and do not connect the short needle directly to the patient. Do not allow the sodium chloride solution to flow into the PLUVICTO vial prior to the initiation of the PLUVICTO infusion and do not inject the PLUVICTO solution directly into the sodium chloride solution. Insert a second needle that is 9 cm, 18 gauge (long needle) into the PLUVICTO vial, ensuring that the long needle touches and is secured to the bottom of the PLUVICTO vial during the entire infusion. Connect the long needle to the patient by an intravenous catheter that is pre-filled with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution and that is used exclusively for the PLUVICTO infusion into the patient. Use a clamp or an infusion pump to regulate the flow of the sodium chloride solution via the short needle into the PLUVICTO vial (the sodium chloride solution entering the vial through the short needle will carry the PLUVICTO solution from the vial to the patient via the intravenous catheter connected to the long needle within approximately 30 minutes). During the infusion, ensure that the level of solution in the PLUVICTO vial remains constant. Disconnect the vial from the long needle line and clamp the saline line once the level of radioactivity is stable for at least five minutes. Follow the infusion with an intravenous flush of ≥ 10 mL of 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution through the intravenous catheter to the patient. Instructions for the Vial Method (With a Peristaltic Infusion Pump) Insert a 2.5 cm, 20 gauge needle (short venting needle) into the PLUVICTO vial. Ensure that the short needle does not touch the PLUVICTO solution in the vial and do not connect the short needle directly to the patient or to the peristaltic infusion pump. Insert a second needle that is 9 cm, 18 gauge (long needle) into the PLUVICTO vial, ensuring that the long needle touches and is secured to the bottom of the PLUVICTO vial during the entire infusion. Connect the long needle and a 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution to a 3-way stopcock valve via appropriate tubing. Connect the output of the 3-way stopcock valve to tubing installed on the input side of the peristaltic infusion pump following the pump manufacturer’s instructions. Pre-fill the line by opening the 3-way stopcock valve and pumping the PLUVICTO solution through the tubing until it reaches the exit of the valve. Pre-fill the intravenous catheter which will be connected to the patient by opening the 3-way stopcock valve to the 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution and pumping the 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution until it exits the end of the catheter tubing. Connect the pre-filled intravenous catheter to the patient and set the 3-way stopcock valve such that the PLUVICTO solution is in line with the peristaltic infusion pump. Infuse an appropriate volume of PLUVICTO solution at approximately 25 mL/h to deliver the desired radioactivity. When the desired PLUVICTO radioactivity has been delivered, stop the peristaltic infusion pump and then change the position of the 3-way stopcock valve so that the peristaltic infusion pump is in line with the 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution. Restart the peristaltic infusion pump and infuse an intravenous flush of ≥ 10 mL of 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution through the intravenous catheter to the patient. 2.6 Radiation Dosimetry Dosimetry of lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan was collected in 29 patients in the VISION sub-study, in order to calculate whole body and organ radiation dosimetry. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the estimated radiation absorbed doses to different organs for adult patients receiving PLUVICTO are shown in Table 2. The organs with the highest radiation absorbed doses are lacrimal glands, salivary glands, large intestine (left and right colon), kidneys, and urinary bladder wall.

DEXAMETHASONE,13,801,Keratoconus,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Oral Administration The initial dosage varies from 0.75 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated. It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable And Must Be Individualized On The Basis Of The Disease Under Treatment And The Response Of The Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS : Neuro-Psychiatric ). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg/m2bsa/day). For the purpose of comparison, the fo ll owing is the equivalent mi lli gram dosage of the various corticosteroids: Dexamethasone, 1.5 Methylprednisolone, 8 Prednisone, 10 Triamcinolone, 8 Prednisolone, 10 Betamethasone, 1.5 Hydrocortisone, 40 Paramethasone, 4 Cortisone, 50 These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered. In acute, self-limited allergic disorders or acute exacerbations of chronic allergic disorders, the following dosage schedule combining parenteral and oral therapy is suggested: Dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection, 4 mg per mL First Day 1 or 2 mL, intramuscularly Dexamethasone tablets, 0.75 mg Second Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Third Day 4 tablets in two divided doses Fourth Day 2 tablets in two divided doses Fifth Day 1 tablet Sixth Day 1 tablet Seventh Day No treatment Eighth Day Follow-up visit This schedule is designed to ensure adequate therapy during acute episodes, while minimizing the risk of overdosage in chronic cases. In cerebral edema , dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection is generally administered initially in a dosage of 10 mg intravenously followed by 4 mg every six hours intramuscularly until the symptoms of cerebral edema subside. Response is usually noted within 12 to 24 hours and dosage may be reduced after two to four days and gradually discontinued over a period of five to seven days. For pal l iative management of patients with recurrent or inoperable brain tumors, maintenance therapy with either dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection or dexamethasone tablets in a dosage of 2 mg two or three times daily may be effective. Dexamethasone Suppression Tests 1. Tests for Cushing’s syndrome Give 1.0 mg of dexamethasone orally at 11:00 p.m. Blood is drawn for plasma cortisol determination at 8:00 a.m. the following morning. For greater accuracy, give 0.5 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine co l ections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion. 2. Test to distinguish Cushing’s syndrome due to pituitary ACTH excess from Cushing’s syndrome due to other causes. Give 2.0 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine co l ections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion.","INDICATIONS AND USAGE A l l ergic States: Control of severe or incapacitating a llergic conditions intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment in asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis, and serum sickness.

For the treatment of dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.","WARNINGS General Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation. Cardio-Renal Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, sodium and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients. Endocrine Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for corticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids and may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. If the patient is receiving steroids already, dosage may have to be increased. Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage. Infections General: Patients who are on corticosteroids are more susceptible to infections than are healthy individuals. There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infection with any pathogen (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic) in any location of the body may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. These infections may be mild to severe. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases. Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of current infection. Fungal Infections: Corticosteroids may exacerbate systemic fungal infections and therefore should not be used in the presence of such infections unless they are needed to control life-threatening drug reactions. There have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions: Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents ). Special Pathogens: Latent disease may be activated or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Amoeba, Candida, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma. It is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or any patient with unexplained diarrhea. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid- induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral malaria. Tuberculosis: The use of corticosteroids in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis. Vaccination: Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Ki l ed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted. Immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for Addison's disease. Viral infections: Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in pediatric and adult patients on corticosteroids. In pediatric and adult patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immune globulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for VZIG and IG for complete prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents should be considered. Ophthalmic: Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex.","Advanced Rx Pharmacy of Tennessee, LLC",DEXAMETHASONE

Premature or Full-Term Neonates 1 Week of Age or Less : Up to 4 mg/kg/day may be administered in 2 equal doses every 12 hours. It is desirable to limit treatment to a short term. The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. A longer course of therapy may be necessary in difficult and complicated infections. In such cases, monitoring of renal, auditory, and vestibular functions is advised, because neurotoxicity is more likely to occur when treatment is extended longer than 10 days. Dosage in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis — In patients with cystic fibrosis, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. Measurement of tobramycin serum concentration during treatment is especially important as a basis for determining appropriate dose. In patients with severe cystic fibrosis, an initial dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg/day in 4 equally divided doses is recommended. This dosing regimen is suggested only as a guide. The serum levels of tobramycin should be measured directly during treatment due to wide interpatient variability. Administration for Patients with Impaired Renal Function — Whenever possible, serum tobramycin concentrations should be monitored during therapy. Following a loading dose of 1 mg/kg, subsequent dosage in these patients must be adjusted, either with reduced doses administered at 8-hour intervals or with normal doses given at prolonged intervals. Both of these methods are suggested as guides to be used when serum levels of tobramycin cannot be measured directly. They are based on either the creatinine clearance or the serum creatinine of the patient because these values correlate with the half-life of tobramycin. The dosage schedule derived from either method should be used in conjunction with careful clinical and laboratory observations of the patient and should be modified as necessary. Neither method should be used when dialysis is being performed. Reduced dosage at 8-hour Intervals — When the creatinine clearance rate is 70 mL or less per minute or when the serum creatinine value is known, the amount of the reduced dose can be determined by multiplying the normal dose from Table 3 by the percent of normal dose from the accompanying nomogram. An alternate rough guide for determining reduced dosage at 8-hour intervals (for patients whose steady-state serum creatinine values are known) is to divide the normally recommended dose by the patient’s serum creatinine. * Scales have been adjusted to facilitate dosage calculations. Normal Dosage at Prolonged Intervals — If the creatinine clearance rate is not available and the patient’s condition is stable, a dosage frequency in hours for the dosage given in Table 3 can be determined by multiplying the patient’s serum creatinine by 6. Dosage in Obese Patients — The appropriate dose may be calculated by using the patient’s estimated lean body weight plus 40% of the excess as the basic weight on which to figure mg/kg. Intravenous Administration — For intravenous administration, the usual volume of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection) is 50 to 100 mL for adult doses. For pediatric patients, the volume of diluent should be proportionately less than that for adults. The diluted solution usually should be infused over a period of 20 to 60 minutes. Infusion periods of less than 20 minutes are not recommended because peak serum levels may exceed 12 mcg/mL (see WARNINGS box). Tobramycin Injection, USP should not be physically premixed with other drugs but should be administered separately according to the recommended dose and route. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Directions for Proper Use of Pharmacy Bulk Package Use Aseptic Technique – Not for Direct Infusion The pharmacy bulk package is for use in a Pharmacy Admixture Service only. 1. For hanger application, peel off the paper liner from both ends of the tape hanger to expose 3/4 in. long adhesive portions. Adhere each end to the label on the bottle. 2. During use, container must be stored and all manipulations performed in an appropriate laminar flow hood. 3. Remove cover from container and cleanse closure with antiseptic. 4. A single entry through the vial closure should be made with a sterile dispensing set which allows measured dispensing of the contents. Transfer individual dose(s) to appropriate intravenous infusion solutions without delay. Use of a syringe with needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage. Multiple entries will also increase the potential of microbial and particulate contamination. The above process should be carried out under a laminar flow hood using aseptic technique. ANY UNUSED PORTION MUST BE DISCARDED WITHIN 4 HOURS. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. tobramycin-spl-figure","INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tobramycin injection is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below: Septicemia in the neonate, child, and adult caused by P. aeruginosa , E. coli , and Klebsiella sp Lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, E. coli , and S. aureus (penicillinase- and non-penicillinase-producing strains) Serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis) caused by susceptible organisms Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, caused by E. coli , Klebsiella sp, and Enterobacter sp. Skin, bone, and skin structure infections caused by P. aeruginosa , Proteus sp, E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp and S. aureus Complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp, (indole-positive and indole- negative), E. coli , Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, S. aureus , Providencia sp, and Citrobacte r sp. Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use. Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients in whom a serious life-threatening gram- negative infection is suspected, including those in whom concurrent therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated, treatment with tobramycin may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts discussed in the WARNINGS box above. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tobramycin Injection and other antimicrobial drugs, Tobramycin Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.","OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms— The severity of the signs and symptoms following a tobramycin overdose are dependent on the dose administered, the patient’s renal function, state of hydration, and age and whether or not other medications with similar toxicities are being administered concurrently. Toxicity may occur in patients treated more than 10 days, in adults given more than 5 mg/kg/day, children given more than 7.5 mg/kg/day, or patients with reduced renal function whose dose has not been appropriately adjusted. Nephrotoxicity following the parenteral administration of an aminoglycoside is most closely related to the area under the curve of the serum concentration versus time graph. Nephrotoxicity is more likely if trough blood concentrations fail to fall below 2 mcg/mL and is also proportional to the average blood concentration. Patients who are elderly, have abnormal renal function, are receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, or are volume depleted are at greater risk for developing acute tubular necrosis. Auditory and vestibular toxicities have been associated with aminoglycoside overdose. These toxicities occur in patients treated longer than 10 days, in patients with abnormal renal function, in dehydrated patients, or in patients receiving medications with additive auditory toxicities. These patients may not have signs or symptoms or may experience dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, and a loss of high-tone acuity as ototoxicity progresses. Ototoxicity signs and symptoms may not begin to occur until long after the drug has been discontinued. Neuromuscular blockade or respiratory paralysis may occur following administration of many aminoglycosides. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with myasthenia gravis or Parkinson’s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving decamethonium, tubocurarine, or succinylcholine. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary. If tobramycin were ingested, toxicity would be less likely because aminoglycosides are poorly absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Treatment— In all cases of suspected overdosage, call your Regional Poison Control Center to obtain the most up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose. This recommendation is made because, in general, information regarding the treatment of overdosage may change more rapidly than the package insert. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. The initial intervention in a tobramycin overdose is to establish an airway and ensure oxygenation and ventilation. Resuscitative measures should be initiated promptly if respiratory paralysis occurs. Patients that have received an overdose of tobramycin and have normal renal function should be adequately hydrated to maintain a urine output of 3 to 5 mL/kg/hr. Fluid balance, creatinine clearance, and tobramycin plasma levels should be carefully monitored until the serum tobramycin level falls below 2 mcg/mL. Patients in whom the elimination half-life is greater than 2 hours or whose renal function is abnormal may require more aggressive therapy. In such patients, hemodialysis may be beneficial.",Gland Pharma Limited,TOBRAMYCIN

INCRUSE ELLIPTA,N/A,N/A,Oxygen saturation decreased,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION BREO ELLIPTA should be administered once daily every day by the orally inhaled route only. BREO ELLIPTA should be taken at the same time every day. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA more than 1 time every 24 hours. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 1 inhalation daily) of the prescribed strength of BREO ELLIPTA is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses. Patients using BREO ELLIPTA should not use additional LABA for any reason. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5, 5.8, 5.12).] • For oral inhalation only. ( 2 ) • Maintenance treatment of COPD: 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily. ( 2.1 ) • Asthma: 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 should be administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily, the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD. If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be taken for immediate relief. 2.2 Asthma If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be taken for immediate relief. The recommended starting dosage is BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily. The starting dosage is based on patients’ asthma severity. For patients previously treated with low- to mid-dose corticosteroid–containing treatment, BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 should be considered. For patients previously treated with mid- to high-dose corticosteroid–containing treatment, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 should be considered. The median time to onset, defined as a 100-mL increase from baseline in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), was approximately 15 minutes after beginning treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, increasing the dose to BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 may provide additional improvement in asthma control. If a previously effective dosage regimen of BREO ELLIPTA fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of BREO ELLIPTA with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BREO ELLIPTA is a combination of fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol, a long-acting beta 2 ‑adrenergic agonist (LABA), indicated for: • Long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction and reducing exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (1.1) • Once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. ( 1.2 ) Important limitation: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm. ( 1.1 , 1.2 , 5.2 ) 1.1 Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease BREO ® ELLIPTA ® 100/25 is a combination inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (ICS/LABA) indicated for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily is the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD. Important Limitation of Use BREO ELLIPTA is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. 1.2 Treatment of Asthma BREO ELLIPTA is a combination ICS/LABA indicated for the once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, physicians should only prescribe BREO ELLIPTA for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue BREO ELLIPTA) if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Important Limitation of Use BREO ELLIPTA is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.","10 OVERDOSAGE No human overdosage data has been reported for BREO ELLIPTA. BREO ELLIPTA contains both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to BREO ELLIPTA. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of BREO ELLIPTA together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta‑receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medicine can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage. 10.1 Fluticasone Furoate Because of low systemic bioavailability (15.2%) and an absence of acute drug-related systemic findings in clinical trials, overdosage of fluticasone furoate is unlikely to require any treatment other than observation. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic effects such as hypercorticism may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Single- and repeat-dose trials of fluticasone furoate at doses of 50 to 4,000 mcg have been studied in human subjects. Decreases in mean serum cortisol were observed at dosages of 500 mcg or higher given once daily for 14 days. 10.2 Vilanterol The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of vilanterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis). As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medicines, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of vilanterol.",N/A,N/A
WIXELA INHUB,N/A,N/A,Oxygen saturation decreased,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Wixela Inhub ® should be administered as 1 inhalation twice daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 1 inhalation twice daily) of the prescribed strength of Wixela Inhub ® is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses of salmeterol. Patients using Wixela Inhub ® should not use additional LABA for any reason. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.12) .] For oral inhalation only. ( 2 ) • Treatment of asthma in patients aged 12 years and older: 1 inhalation of Wixela Inhub ® 100/50, Wixela Inhub ® 250/50, or Wixela Inhub ® 500/50 twice daily. Starting dosage is based on asthma severity. ( 2.1 ) • Treatment of asthma in patients aged 4 to 11 years: 1 inhalation of Wixela Inhub ® 100/50 twice daily. ( 2.1 ) • Maintenance treatment of COPD: 1 inhalation of Wixela Inhub ® 250/50 twice daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Asthma If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist should be taken for immediate relief. Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older For patients aged 12 years and older, the dosage is 1 inhalation twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart. When choosing the starting dosage strength of Wixela Inhub ® , consider the patients’ disease severity, based on their previous asthma therapy, including the ICS dosage, as well as the patients’ current control of asthma symptoms and risk of future exacerbation. The maximum recommended dosage is Wixela Inhub ® 500/50 twice daily. Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of Wixela Inhub ® can occur within 30 minutes of beginning treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dosage after 2 weeks of therapy, replacing the current strength of Wixela Inhub ® with a higher strength may provide additional improvement in asthma control. If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of Wixela Inhub ® with a higher strength, adding additional ICS, initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered. Pediatric Patients Aged 4 to 11 Years For patients with asthma aged 4 to 11 years who are not controlled on an ICS, the dosage is 1 inhalation of Wixela Inhub ® 100/50 twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart. 2.2 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease The recommended dosage for patients with COPD is 1 inhalation of Wixela Inhub ® 250/50 twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart. If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2- agonist should be taken for immediate relief.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Wixela Inhub ® is a combination product containing a corticosteroid and a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA) indicated for: • Twice-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 4 years and older.

Wixela Inhub ® 250/50 is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. Wixela Inhub ® 250/50 twice daily is the only approved dosage for the treatment of COPD because an efficacy advantage of the higher strength Wixela Inhub ® 500/50 over Wixela Inhub ® 250/50 has not been demonstrated. Important Limitation of Use Wixela Inhub ® is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.","10 OVERDOSAGE No human overdosage data has been reported for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. Wixela Inhub ® contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to Wixela Inhub ® . Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of Wixela Inhub ® together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage. 10.1 Fluticasone Propionate Chronic overdosage of fluticasone propionate may result in signs/symptoms of hypercorticism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Inhalation by healthy volunteers of a single dose of 4,000 mcg of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder or single doses of 1,760 or 3,520 mcg of fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol was well tolerated. Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation aerosol at dosages of 1,320 mcg twice daily for 7 to 15 days to healthy human volunteers was also well tolerated. Repeat oral doses up to 80 mg daily for 10 days in healthy volunteers and repeat oral doses up to 20 mg daily for 42 days in subjects were well tolerated. Adverse reactions were of mild or moderate severity, and incidences were similar in active and placebo treatment groups. 10.2 Salmeterol The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of salmeterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis). Overdosage with salmeterol can lead to clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which can produce ventricular arrhythmias.

PULMICORT TURBUHALER,N/A,N/A,Oxygen saturation decreased,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be administered twice daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1) ]. Patients should be instructed to prime PULMICORT FLEXHALER prior to its initial use, and instructed to inhale deeply and forcefully each time the device is used. The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER when administered in excess of recommended doses have not been established. After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1-2 weeks of therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, increasing the dose may provide additional asthma control. For oral inhalation only. Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily. (2.1) Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: The recommended starting dosage is 180 mcg twice daily. In some pediatric patients, a starting dose of 360 mcg twice daily may be appropriate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 360 mcg twice daily. (2.1) 2.1 Asthma If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist should be taken for immediate relief. Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily. Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: The recommended starting dosage is 180 mcg twice daily. In some pediatric patients, a starting dose of 360 mcg twice daily may be appropriate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 360 mcg twice daily. For all patients, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dose after adequate asthma stability is achieved. Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of budesonide can occur within 24 hours of initiation of treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks, or longer. Individual patients will experience a variable onset and degree of symptom relief. If a previously effective dosage regimen of PULMICORT FLEXHALER fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g. replacing the lower strength of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the higher strength or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.",1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PULMICORT FLEXHALER is a corticosteroid indicated for: • Maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in adult and pediatric patients six years of age or older.

Important Limitations of Use: PULMICORT FLEXHALER is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.,"10 OVERDOSAGE The potential for acute toxic effects following overdose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is low. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism may occur [see Warnings and Precautions, Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression (5.6) ]. Another budesonide-containing dry powder inhaler at 3200 mcg daily administered for 6 weeks caused a significant reduction (27%) in the plasma cortisol response to a 6-hour infusion of ACTH compared with placebo (+1%). The corresponding effect of 10 mg prednisone daily was a 35% reduction in the plasma cortisol response to ACTH. The minimal inhalation lethal dose in mice was 100 mg/kg (approximately 280 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 330 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m 2 basis). There were no deaths following the administration of an inhalation dose of 68 mg/kg in rats (approximately 380 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 450 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m 2 basis). The minimal oral lethal dose was 200 mg/kg in mice (approximately 560 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 670 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m 2 basis) and less than 100 mg/kg in rats (approximately 560 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 670 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age based on a mcg/m 2 basis). Post-marketing experience showed that acute overdose of inhaled budesonide commonly remained asymptomatic.

BISOPROLOL,N/A,N/A,Oxygen saturation decreased,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose of bisoprolol fumarate tablets must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily. In some patients, 2.5 mg may be an appropriate starting dose (see Bronchospastic Disease in WARNINGS ). If the antihypertensive effect of 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min), the initial daily dose should be 2.5 mg and caution should be used in dose-titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialyzable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis. Geriatric Patients It is not necessary to adjust the dose in the elderly, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction (see above and Geriatric Use in PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatric Patients There is no pediatric experience with bisoprolol fumarate tablets.",INDICATIONS AND USAGE Bisoprolol fumarate tablets are indicated in the management of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.,"OVERDOSAGE The most common signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia, hypotension, congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia. To date, a few cases of overdose (maximum: 2000 mg) with bisoprolol fumarate have been reported. Bradycardia and/or hypotension were noted. Sympathomimetic agents were given in some cases, and all patients recovered. In general, if overdose occurs, bisoprolol fumarate tablets therapy should be stopped and supportive and symptomatic treatment should be provided. Limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialyzable. Based on the expected pharmacologic actions and recommendations for other beta-blockers, the following general measures should be considered when clinically warranted: Bradycardia Administer IV atropine. If the response is inadequate, isoproterenol or another agent with positive chronotropic properties may be given cautiously. Under some circumstances, transvenous pacemaker insertion may be necessary. Hypotension IV fluids and vasopressors should be administered. Intravenous glucagon may be useful. Heart Block (second or third degree) Patients should be carefully monitored and treated with isoproterenol infusion or transvenous cardiac pacemaker insertion, as appropriate. Congestive Heart Failure Initiate conventional therapy (ie, digitalis, diuretics, inotropic agents, vasodilating agents). Bronchospasm Administer bronchodilator therapy such as isoproterenol and/or aminophylline. Hypoglycemia Administer IV glucose.","Solco Healthcare US, LLC",BISOPROLOL FUMARATE

Allow tablet to dissolve without swallowing. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes until relief is obtained. No more than three tablets are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the pain persists after a total of 3 tablets in a 15-minute period, or if the pain is different than is typically experienced, seek prompt medical attention. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may be used prophylactically 5 to 10 minutes prior to engaging in activities that might precipitate an acute attack. For patients with xerostomia, a small sip of water prior to placing the tablet under the tongue may help maintain mucosal hydration and aid dissolution of the tablet. Administer nitroglycerin sublingual tablets at rest, preferably in the sitting position. • At the onset of an attack, administer one tablet under the tongue or buccal pouch. One additional tablet may be administered every 5 minutes as needed. No more than 3 total tablets are recommended within a 15 minute period.

Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are a nitrate vasodilator indicated for relief of an attack or prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. ( 1 ),"10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Signs and Symptoms, Methemoglobinemia Nitrate overdosage may result in: severe hypotension, persistent throbbing headache, vertigo, palpitation, visual disturbance, flushing and perspiring skin (later becoming cold and cyanotic), nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea), syncope (especially in the upright posture), methemoglobinemia with cyanosis and anorexia, initial hyperpnea, dyspnea and slow breathing, slow pulse (dicrotic and intermittent), heart block, increased intracranial pressure with cerebral symptoms of confusion and moderate fever, paralysis and coma followed by clonic convulsions, and possibly death due to circulatory collapse. Case reports of clinically significant methemoglobinemia are rare at conventional doses of organic nitrates. The formation of methemoglobin is dose-related and in the case of genetic abnormalities of hemoglobin that favor methemoglobin formation, even conventional doses of organic nitrates could produce harmful concentrations of methemoglobin. 10.2 Treatment of Overdosage As hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known. Keep the patient recumbent in a shock position and comfortably warm. Passive movement of the extremities may aid venous return. Intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary. Administer oxygen and artificial ventilation, if necessary. If methemoglobinemia is present, administration of methylene blue (1% solution), 1-2 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously, may be required unless the patient is known to have G-6-PD deficiency. If an excessive quantity of nitroglycerin has been recently swallowed gastric lavage may be of use.

RAMIPRIL,N/A,N/A,Oxygen saturation decreased,"2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Hypertension: Initial dose is 2.5 mg to 20 mg once daily. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure response after 2–4 weeks of treatment. The usual maintenance dose following titration is 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily as a single dose or equally divided doses ( 2.1 ). • Heart failure post-myocardial infarction: Starting dose of 2.5 mg twice daily. If patient becomes hypotensive at this dose, decrease dosage to 1.25 mg twice daily. Increase dose as tolerated toward a target dose of 5 mg twice daily, with dosage increases about 3 weeks apart ( 2.3 ). • Dosage adjustment: See respective sections pertaining to dosage adjustment in special situations ( 2.5 ). 2.1 Hypertension The recommended initial dose for patients not receiving a diuretic is 2.5 mg once a day. Adjust dose according to blood pressure response. The usual maintenance dosage range is 2.5 mg to 20 mg per day administered as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, consider an increase in dosage or twice daily administration. If blood pressure is not controlled with ramipril alone, a diuretic can be added. 2.3 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction For the treatment of post-myocardial infarction patients who have shown signs of congestive heart failure, the recommended starting dose of ramipril is 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg per day). A patient who becomes hypotensive at this dose may be switched to 1.25 mg twice daily. After one week at the starting dose, increase dose (if tolerated) toward a target dose of 5 mg twice daily, with dosage increases being about 3 weeks apart. After the initial dose of ramipril, observe the patient under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour. If possible, reduce the dose of any concomitant diuretic as this may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of ramipril does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.5 ) , DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7.1 ) ]. 2.4 General Dosing Information Generally, swallow ramipril capsules whole. The ramipril capsule can also be opened and the contents sprinkled on a small amount (about 4 oz.) of applesauce or mixed in 4 oz. (120 mL) of water or apple juice. To be sure that ramipril is not lost when such a mixture is used, consume the mixture in its entirety. The described mixtures can be pre-prepared and stored for up to 24 hours at room temperature or up to 48 hours under refrigeration. Concomitant administration of ramipril with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.8 ) ] . 2.5 Dosage Adjustment Renal Impairment Establish baseline renal function in patients initiating ramipril capsules. Usual regimens of therapy with ramipril capsule may be followed in patients with estimated creatinine clearance >40 mL/min. However, in patients with worse impairment, 25 % of the usual dose of ramipril capsule is expected to produce full therapeutic levels of ramiprilat [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.) ]. Hypertension For patients with hypertension and renal impairment, the recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg ramipril once daily. Dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum total daily dose of 5 mg. Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction For patients with heart failure and renal impairment, the recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg ramipril once daily. The dose may be increased to 1.25 mg twice daily, and up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg twice daily depending on clinical response and tolerability. Volume Depletion or Renal Artery Stenosis Blood pressure decreases associated with any dose of ramipril depend, in part, on the presence or absence of volume depletion (e.g., past and current diuretic use) or the presence or absence of renal artery stenosis. If such circumstances are suspected to be present, initiate dosing at 1.25 mg once daily. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure response.",1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE • Ramipril capsules USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. ( 1.1 ). • Ramipril capsules USP are indicated in stable patients who have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure post-myocardial infarction ( 1.3 ). 1.1 Hypertension Ramipril capsules USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. 1.3 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction Ramipril capsules USP are indicated in stable patients who have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure within the first few days after sustaining acute myocardial infarction. Administration of ramipril to such patients has been shown to decrease the risk of death (principally cardiovascular death) and to decrease the risks of failure-related hospitalization and progression to severe/resistant heart failure [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.3 ) ].,"10. OVERDOSAGE Single oral doses of ramipril in rats and mice of 10 g/kg to 11 g/kg resulted in significant lethality. In dogs, oral doses as high as 1 g/kg induced only mild gastrointestinal distress. Limited data on human overdosage are available. The most likely clinical manifestations would be symptoms attributable to hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of ramipril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of ramipril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of ramipril and its metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which, if any, of these substances can be effectively removed from the body by hemodialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of ramipril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of ramipril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat ramipril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution.",Proficient Rx LP,RAMIPRIL
TRELEGY ELLIPTA,N/A,N/A,Oxygen saturation decreased,"2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION BREO ELLIPTA should be administered once daily every day by the orally inhaled route only. BREO ELLIPTA should be taken at the same time every day. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA more than 1 time every 24 hours. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 1 inhalation daily) of the prescribed strength of BREO ELLIPTA is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses. Patients using BREO ELLIPTA should not use additional LABA for any reason. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5, 5.8, 5.12).] • For oral inhalation only. ( 2 ) • Maintenance treatment of COPD: 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily. ( 2.1 ) • Asthma: 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 should be administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily, the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD. If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be taken for immediate relief. 2.2 Asthma If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be taken for immediate relief. The recommended starting dosage is BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 administered as 1 inhalation once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 once daily. The starting dosage is based on patients’ asthma severity. For patients previously treated with low- to mid-dose corticosteroid–containing treatment, BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 should be considered. For patients previously treated with mid- to high-dose corticosteroid–containing treatment, BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 should be considered. The median time to onset, defined as a 100-mL increase from baseline in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), was approximately 15 minutes after beginning treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to BREO ELLIPTA 100/25, increasing the dose to BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 may provide additional improvement in asthma control. If a previously effective dosage regimen of BREO ELLIPTA fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of BREO ELLIPTA with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.","1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BREO ELLIPTA is a combination of fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol, a long-acting beta 2 ‑adrenergic agonist (LABA), indicated for: • Long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction and reducing exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (1.1) • Once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. ( 1.2 ) Important limitation: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm. ( 1.1 , 1.2 , 5.2 ) 1.1 Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease BREO ® ELLIPTA ® 100/25 is a combination inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (ICS/LABA) indicated for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 once daily is the only strength indicated for the treatment of COPD. Important Limitation of Use BREO ELLIPTA is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. 1.2 Treatment of Asthma BREO ELLIPTA is a combination ICS/LABA indicated for the once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, physicians should only prescribe BREO ELLIPTA for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue BREO ELLIPTA) if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Important Limitation of Use BREO ELLIPTA is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.","10 OVERDOSAGE No human overdosage data has been reported for BREO ELLIPTA. BREO ELLIPTA contains both fluticasone furoate and vilanterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to BREO ELLIPTA. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of BREO ELLIPTA together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta‑receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medicine can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage. 10.1 Fluticasone Furoate Because of low systemic bioavailability (15.2%) and an absence of acute drug-related systemic findings in clinical trials, overdosage of fluticasone furoate is unlikely to require any treatment other than observation. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic effects such as hypercorticism may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Single- and repeat-dose trials of fluticasone furoate at doses of 50 to 4,000 mcg have been studied in human subjects. Decreases in mean serum cortisol were observed at dosages of 500 mcg or higher given once daily for 14 days. 10.2 Vilanterol The expected signs and symptoms with overdosage of vilanterol are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the signs and symptoms of beta-adrenergic stimulation (e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis). As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medicines, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of vilanterol.",N/A,N/A

BISOPROLOL,76,801,Hepatitis,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose of bisoprolol fumarate tablets must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily. In some patients, 2.5 mg may be an appropriate starting dose (see Bronchospastic Disease in WARNINGS ). If the antihypertensive effect of 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min), the initial daily dose should be 2.5 mg and caution should be used in dose-titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialyzable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis. Geriatric Patients It is not necessary to adjust the dose in the elderly, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction (see above and Geriatric Use in PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatric Patients There is no pediatric experience with bisoprolol fumarate tablets.",INDICATIONS AND USAGE Bisoprolol fumarate tablets are indicated in the management of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.,"OVERDOSAGE The most common signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia, hypotension, congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia. To date, a few cases of overdose (maximum: 2000 mg) with bisoprolol fumarate have been reported. Bradycardia and/or hypotension were noted. Sympathomimetic agents were given in some cases, and all patients recovered. In general, if overdose occurs, bisoprolol fumarate tablets therapy should be stopped and supportive and symptomatic treatment should be provided. Limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialyzable. Based on the expected pharmacologic actions and recommendations for other beta-blockers, the following general measures should be considered when clinically warranted: Bradycardia Administer IV atropine. If the response is inadequate, isoproterenol or another agent with positive chronotropic properties may be given cautiously. Under some circumstances, transvenous pacemaker insertion may be necessary. Hypotension IV fluids and vasopressors should be administered. Intravenous glucagon may be useful. Heart Block (second or third degree) Patients should be carefully monitored and treated with isoproterenol infusion or transvenous cardiac pacemaker insertion, as appropriate. Congestive Heart Failure Initiate conventional therapy (ie, digitalis, diuretics, inotropic agents, vasodilating agents). Bronchospasm Administer bronchodilator therapy such as isoproterenol and/or aminophylline. Hypoglycemia Administer IV glucose.","Solco Healthcare US, LLC",BISOPROLOL FUMARATE
